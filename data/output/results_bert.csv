Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

BEIJING (AP) — Heavy rain in China has claimed six lives this week and forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people.

Five people died in southeastern China, according to state media reports: A house collapse took three lives in Fujian province on Tuesday, and two died Monday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in neighboring Jiangxi province.

One person died and three are missing in northern China after a vehicle fell into the water in mountain flooding from heavy rain in the Inner Mongolia region.

China regularly experiences seasonal rains and flooding during the summer, most frequently in central and southern areas.

Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed large parts of cities flooded in muddy waters. Rescue workers carried trapped people out of buildings on their backs in waist-deep water in Guangdong province, also in the southeast.

The rain ended Wednesday in Jiangxi, but more precipitation is forecast for another week in Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong and the nearby Guangxi region. The National Meteorological Center said residents should prepare for floods and landslides as the soil is already saturated in those areas.

More than 110,000 people have been relocated in Jiangxi province, along with more than 80,000 in Fujian, state media reports said.

Seventeen people died last week in rain-related disasters in Guangxi and in Hunan province in central China.

BEIJING (AP) — Heavy rainstorms are causing major flooding and landslides in southern China, destroying buildings, crops and roads, and forcing many people to flee their homes.

In the Guangxi autonomous region, 145,000 people were relocated to safety and more than 10,000 houses were destroyed, the official Xinhua New Agency reported.

Another half million people were affected in neighboring Jiangxi province, where 433,000 hectares (1 million acres) of crops were flooded, according to local authorities.

Around 274,000 people have sought relief in Guangzhou province, according to the provincial emergency management department.

The heavy rainfall has collapsed roads in some parts of cities and swept away houses, cars and crops. The meteorological department has forecast more rain in coming days. Chinese authorities on Sunday issued the year’s first red alert, the most severe warning, for possible mountain torrents.

China regularly experiences flooding during the summer months, most frequently in central and southern areas that tend to receive the most rainfall.

China’s worst floods in recent years were in 1998, when more than 2,000 people died and almost 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along the Yangtze, China’s mightiest river.

The government has invested heavily in flood control and hydroelectric projects such as the massive Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze.

Globally, more intense tropical storms are on the rise as a result of climate change, leading to increased flooding, threatening lives, crops and groundwater.

GARDINER, Mont. – Yellowstone National Park officials assessed widespread damage Tuesday as the park remained closed amid dangerous floods, mudslides and rockslides that have eroded roads, ripped apart bridges and forced evacuations this week.

The water started to slowly recede Tuesday and one key highway reopened, but the record-level floods left all five entrances to the park closed through at least Wednesday, officials said. And, officials said during an update on Tuesday, the water levels could still change at any time.

“The water is still raging,” said Park Superintendent Cam Sholly, who added that more wet weather was forecast this weekend, which could cause additional flooding.

The park, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, has seen multiple road and bridge failures, power outages and mudslides, causing the evacuations of more than 10,000 visitors from the park.

“I’ve never seen this, not in my lifetime,” said Austin King, a firefighter and EMT in Gardiner, a town just outside Yellowstone's busy northern entrance.

There were no reports of injuries or deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, but floodwaters swept away a number of homes, bridges and other structures. The northern part of the park suffered the worst damage.

The full scope of the damage was not known Tuesday, leaving it unclear when roads might reopen or when residents in neighboring communities might be able to return.

The northern loop of Yellowstone National Park was cleared of visitors and park officials were working to evacuate visitors in the southern area of the park Tuesday. Park staff were searching for five back-country groups to ensure they were safely evacuated.

Meanwhile, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster and said the Montana National Guard rescued 12 people stranded by high waters in Roscoe and Cooke City.

Highways reopen as floodwaters recede

The Yellowstone River reached highs of almost 14 feet on Monday, far higher than the record 11.5 feet set more than a century ago, according the the National Weather Service.

Although the water was still ""extremely"" high, a route out of Gardiner, a town of about 900 people, reopened Tuesday afternoon, according to county Commissioner Bill Berg and Sholly.

Visitors could drive out using U.S. Highway 89 and East River Road, but only residents and service vehicles were allowed to drive back inside. While some residents questioned if they could wait a few days before leaving town, Berg and Sholly were adamant: “Get out of Gardiner.”

""We are working with the county and state of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,"" Yellowstone officials said Monday.

A smaller highway into the previously isolated Cooke City also reopened to local traffic and emergency services Tuesday afternoon.

Yellowstone communities left stranded, without power

The flooding left some of Yellowstone's small gateway communities in southern Montana isolated and without power, leading to evacuations by boat and helicopter.

Floodwaters isolated areas including Silvergate, which is east of the park, and led to evacuations in Livingston. As Stillwater River in south-central Montana flooded, 68 people were stranded at a campground as crews rescued campers by raft.

Officials in Park County, which encompasses those cities, issued shelter-in-place orders Monday and warned flooding had made drinking water unsafe in many communities. Residents hauled bottled water home from stores and worried about a possible food shortage.

Many in Gardiner have used only bottled water to brush their teeth, wash dishes and prepare food due to a break in the area's main water service line. The community was under an advisory to boil water before consumption as of Tuesday afternoon.

The county said water and air rescues were underway amid evacuations Monday.

""Extensive flooding throughout Park County has washed out bridges, roads, and left communities and homes isolated,"" Park County said in a statement.

A 10-person bunker was among the buildings that slipped from the riverbank into the water. Only a portion of the building's foundation remained Tuesday.

Parker Manning, who was visiting from Terre Haute, Indiana, watched the flooding from a cabin in Gardiner. He said he saw trees and a mostly intact house floating in rushing waters.

In the south-central Montana town of Joliet, Kristan Apodaca cried as she watched floodwaters overtake her grandmother's log cabin and the park where her husband proposed.

""I am sixth-generation,"" she told the Billings Gazette. ""This is our home.""

King, the EMT in Gardiner, said the flooding was ""damaging for a lot of people.""

""Some have lost their houses; others can’t go to work,"" King said. ""People are worried about food shortages already.""

When will Yellowstone reopen?

Yellowstone officials have prohibited visitors from entering the park at any of its five entrances until at least Wednesday.

Sholly said the park could remain closed as long as a week, and northern entrances may not reopen at all this summer.

Cory Mottice, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Billings, Montana, said reduced rain and cooler temperatures, which could lead to decreased snowmelt, may lessen flooding.

Still, ""this is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,"" Mottice said.

Why is Yellowstone flooding?

Record rainfall combined with rapidly melting snowpack caused the deluge of flooding this week. Scientists pointed to climate change as the culprit behind more intense and frequent weather events.

The flooding happened as the summer tourist season was ramping up. June is one of the park's busiest months.

What state is Yellowstone National Park in?

The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park encompasses nearly 3,500 square miles on top of a volcanic hot spot. The park lies mostly in Wyoming but spreads into Montana and Idaho.

The park allows visitors ""to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River,"" according to the Yellowstone's website.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service was working to reach visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone, officials said.

“Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues,” the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The “gateway” community of Gardiner, Montana, just north of the park’s northern boundary and home to many Yellowstone staff members, has been cut off due to a mudslide in the vicinity, according to the National Park Service.

Electric power was knocked out in multiple areas of the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous sections of roads throughout Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the park service said.

Various roads in the park’s southern tier were on the verge of being flooded, according to the agency.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider region after one of its wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the levels of rainfall and flooding sweeping the park as unprecedented.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park’s higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the US summer tourist season, which accounts for the bulk of Yellowstone’s annual 4 million visitors.",Record flooding and mudslides force closure of Yellowstone national park,[],2022-06-13 00:00:00,,"Record flooding and rockslides following a burst of heavy rains prompted the rare closure on Monday of all five entrances to Yellowstone national park at the start of the summer tourist season, the park superintendent said.

Visitors to Yellowstone National Park were seen narrowly escaping with their lives after a rockslide began falling on their vehicle amid devastating floods.

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

CODY, Wyo., June 13 (Reuters) - Record flooding and rockslides unleashed by an unprecedented burst of heavy rains prompted the rare closure on Monday of all five entrances to Yellowstone National Park at the start of the summer tourist season, the park superintendent said.

The entire park, spanning parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, will remain closed to visitors, including those with lodging and camping reservations, at least through Wednesday, as officials inspect damage to roads, bridges and other facilities.

The closures come as Yellowstone was gearing up to celebrate its 150th anniversary year, and as local communities heavily dependent on tourism were counting on a rebound following COVID-19 travel restrictions over the past two summers.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service said it was working to evacuate visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone.

""It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time,"" the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The ""gateway"" community of Gardiner, Montana, just beyond the park's northern boundary and home to many of Yellowstone's workers, was cut off by a mudslide to the north and washed-out road surfaces to the south, according to the National Park Service.

Aerial footage released by the Park Service showed large swaths of the winding North Entrance Road between Gardiner and park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, carved away by surging floodwaters along the Gardner River - washouts that will likely take months to fully repair.

Power outages were scattered throughout the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous roadways across Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the agency said.

Various roads in the park's southern region were on the verge of being flooded, with more rain in the forecast.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider Intermountain West following one of the region's wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the rainfall and floods sweeping the park as unprecedented, with the Yellowstone River topping its banks beyond record levels.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park's higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the U.S. summer tourist season, which accounts of the bulk of Yellowstone's annual 4 million visitors.

Yellowstone, established as the world's first national park in 1872 and treasured as one of America's top outdoor travel destinations, occupies some 2.2 million acres (890,308 hectares)famed for its geysers, abundant wildlife and spectacular scenery.

A series of “unprecedented” rainstorms have created chaos inside Yellowstone National Park, which closed its gates to visitors on Monday.

The severe weather caused mudslides, with multiple roads being rendered impassible, and a bridge getting destroyed.

""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and others issues,"" park superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement.

Guests already inside the park have been evacuated, and no return date has been announced.

Video footage released the National Parks Service (NPS) shows the northern entrance road to the park from Gardiner, Montana destroyed as water rushes through the canyon.

Communities outside of Yellowstone like Gardiner have been isolated, as roads going in and out of town are rendered impassible.

One family staying in the area in a rental home told CNN they were stranded.

“The water levels were high on Saturday but within the past 10-12 hours things have gotten rougher,” said Parker Manning, who was visiting from Indiana.

Water levels on the Yellowstone River in Corwin Springs, Montana had blown past its previous record high by at least two feet, according to the US Geological Survey. Other rivers in the area were also far above normal levels.

Power is out in some parts of the popular natural park.

It is unclear when the park could re-open.

“We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we’re able to assess the damage throughout the park,” Mr Sholly said in the statement. “It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time.”

The flooding was caused by intense rainfall, coupled with increased snowmelt. The AP reports that the park saw 2.5 inches of rain fall from Saturday to Monday, with areas nearby recording up to four inches.

In addition, recent warmer temperatures have spurred increased snowmelt in the area, adding even more water to the landscape.

The park is one of the most popular outdoor recreation spots in the US, receiving more than 800,000 visitors a year on average.

The climate crisis is expected to bring significant change to the Yellowstone ecosystem, NPS says. In particular, warmer temperatures will likely bring decreased snowpack and a higher chance of wildfires.

Climate change may also bring more severe storms across the country. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, more rain is now coming during intense rainstorms than in years prior — which could lead to more flash flooding events.

Helena, Mon. (NEXSTAR) —On Monday, a deluge wiped out at least one bridge, washed away roads, and caused a landslide in Yellowstone National Park.

Authorities closed all five entrances, began evacuating visitors from the northern part of the park, and warned that the park was temporarily closed due to a “very dangerous situation.”

Park officials said roads to and from the Gardiner community in Montana, just north of the park, were impassable. Kam Sholy said the loop on the north side of the park could be closed for quite some time.

Park officials planned to evacuate visitors from the park’s South Loop on Monday afternoon. This is because more rain is expected.

Higher levels of flood forecasts prompted the decision, along with concerns about water and wastewater, according to Shory.

Agartala: The incessant rains across the Northeast are now putting pressure on states like Tripura, Mizoram and Barak valley, as the road considered the lifeline for these regions—the National Highway 6—witnessed several landslides, especially in Meghalaya.

Tripura, for now, seems to be the worst hit due to the disruptions across National Highway 6. Higher officials of the food and civil supplies department said if the road connectivity is restored within a few days, there would be no major effect. However, if the traffic remains disrupted for the long term, a crisis may hit the state markets. “The present stock of food grains is enough for this month. Earlier, large quantities of rice and other essential grains could be transported through railways. In absence of railway services, we are largely dependent on roadways. And definitely, the supply chain needs to remain unaffected when we have only one route operational,” Saradindu Chowdhury, secretary, Tripura Food and Civil Supplies department told EastMojo.

Railway services were snapped after heavy rains triggered landslides and inundated Haflong railway station. Expectedly, the railway operations are slated to resume on July 10. “As per the reports we have received from the National Highway Authorities, the road will be restored within the next two to three days. We are in constant touch with the highway authorities and accordingly, steps will be undertaken,” principal secretary, transport department told EastMojo.

However, as per the sources in the food and civil supplies department, the state has a stock of essential food grains for the next ten to fifteen days while the stock of petroleum oil is enough for the next eight to ten days. “The alternative Guwahati-Agartala route through Bangladesh is still operational and IOCL is transporting gas bullets frequently. If the road connectivity also gets halted for a long time, we would be compelled to depend on the transport route through Bangladesh for transit of essentials,” said a top source in the department.

","Meghalaya landslide: Crisis of essentials in Tripura, Mizoram next?",[],2022-06-16 00:00:00,,"Agartala: The incessant rains across the Northeast are now putting pressure on states like Tripura, Mizoram and Barak valley, as the road considered the lifeline for these regions—the National Highway 6—witnessed several landslides, especially in Meghalaya.

Tripura, for now, seems to be the worst hit due to the disruptions across National Highway 6. Higher officials of the food and civil supplies department said if the road connectivity is restored within a few days, there would be no major effect. However, if the traffic remains disrupted for the long term, a crisis may hit the state markets. “The present stock of food grains is enough for this month. Earlier, large quantities of rice and other essential grains could be transported through railways. In absence of railway services, we are largely dependent on roadways. And definitely, the supply chain needs to remain unaffected when we have only one route operational,” Saradindu Chowdhury, secretary, Tripura Food and Civil Supplies department told EastMojo.

Railway services were snapped after heavy rains triggered landslides and inundated Haflong railway station. Expectedly, the railway operations are slated to resume on July 10. “As per the reports we have received from the National Highway Authorities, the road will be restored within the next two to three days. We are in constant touch with the highway authorities and accordingly, steps will be undertaken,” principal secretary, transport department told EastMojo.

However, as per the sources in the food and civil supplies department, the state has a stock of essential food grains for the next ten to fifteen days while the stock of petroleum oil is enough for the next eight to ten days. “The alternative Guwahati-Agartala route through Bangladesh is still operational and IOCL is transporting gas bullets frequently. If the road connectivity also gets halted for a long time, we would be compelled to depend on the transport route through Bangladesh for transit of essentials,” said a top source in the department.

Mizoram, on the other hand, seems prepared for the floods better than Tripura. For now, according to people EastMojo spoke with, the state has essentials thanks to the road between Silchar and Aizawl which is still functioning.

MONTREAL - The Quebec government was preparing Monday to extend a local state of emergency to a neighbourhood in Saguenay, Que., north of Quebec City, after almost 200 people were recently forced from their homes due to a threat of landslides.

About 187 residents had to relocate from the La Baie district after a landslide destroyed a house last week. Dominic Arseneau, a spokesperson for the city of Saguenay, said the city declared a local state of emergency Saturday night and planned to make an official request Monday evening to the province to extend it.

The evacuated area, Arseneau said in an interview, remains unstable and other landslides are “imminent and inevitable.”

“We know it’s going to happen, we just don’t know when,” he added.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Monday she was waiting on the official request from the city before signing the state of emergency order. She said the declaration would allow Saguenay to sidestep the usual paperwork and more easily requisition property, sign contracts and redirect traffic.

“We need a good reason to declare state of emergency, but it’s rare that a municipality will ask for it if they don’t need to,” Guilbault said.

Arseneau said emergency levees have been erected in the affected part of the city to avoid any more displacement and to stop debris and mud from sliding further into the area.

Several groups have offered to shelter displaced families, most of whom had a few hours to pack their belongings and didn’t know whether they would be able to return to their homes.

Marie-Chantale Tremblay says she called her mother, 57, and stepfather, 66, slightly before 10 p.m. on Saturday after seeing on social media that people were evacuating the La Baie neighbourhood.

“My mom didn’t believe it at first, but everything happened so quickly,” Tremblay said Monday in an interview. “We tried to take as much as we could … They left their home, the memories behind.”

Contact Nature, a non-profit that owns two campgrounds in La Baie, is one of the groups that have offered to provide free accommodation to the families affected by the landslides. Its CEO, Marc-André Galbrand, says that five families, including Tremblay’s, have contacted him.

“There are no words; we are devastated like everyone else by what is happening,” Galbrand said in an interview Monday. “We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible.”

Meanwhile, residents were scheduled to meet on Monday with government officials about the different types of assistance programs available to people who are searching for emergency accommodation. Each person who was forced from their home will receive $20 a day for living expenses, the public security department said.

Quebec is also offering $260,000 to those who won’t be able to return to their homes, Guilbault said.

“The city of Saguenay suffered a lot in the past,” she said about the natural disasters that have hit the city. “Right now, people are very proactive because of it, but at one point, people are fed up. We will be there; we know it’s difficult.”

Didier Perret, a research scientist with Natural Resources Canada who has been studying landslides in the Saguenay area since 1996, says the region is known for its unstable clay soil. The city, Perret added, meets a lot of the criteria for landslides.

The affected district is located on a hill with a steep incline, and recent heavy rains have made the soil particularly unstable, he said.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Que., also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a major landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people. In 1996, the Chicoutimi River flooded, triggering landslides and causing damage that killed at least 10 people, forcing thousands from their homes.

“Those events are still remembered,” Perret said. “When landslides happen, it brings back bad memories.”

Heavy rains across the Pacific Northwest spurred concerns about minor flooding and landslides in parts of Oregon.

Federal water managers are increasing water storage behind the John Day Dam in northeastern Oregon to help with water levels further down the Columbia River Basin.

“This precipitation has fallen on our mountain snowpack which has added even more water into our river systems,” said Steve Barton of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a press release.

Barton said several points throughout the basin will reach flood stage.

“Of primary concern to us at this point is public safety,” he said. “This system of dams was built primarily to protect the public from catastrophic floods. While we cannot prevent all flooding, we can take steps to minimize the impacts of these powerful weather events.”

Rising water levels in the Willamette River closed a portion of Portland’s popular multi-use path, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, from the Morrison Bridge to the Steel Bridge. City officials say it could remain closed for several days. The river is expected to rise to 15.5 feet.

The Columbia River also rose over the weekend, reaching 15.6 feet by mid-Sunday. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning along the river from Vancouver to Longview.

Flood stage in Vancouver is 16 feet (4.87 meters), and forecasters say river levels will approach that level repeatedly through late Wednesday morning. At 16 feet, minor flooding occurs, affecting islands and low-lying areas, with minor impacts on parks or trails along the river, according to the National Weather Service.

The NWS also issued a flood watch for much of northeastern Oregon through Sunday night. Officials warned people to be on the lookout for potential landslides.

Landslides can occur near steep terrain, especially near burned areas from recent wildfires, and they can move faster than a person can run.

Emergency officials are warning swimmers to stay away from local rivers in the coming days, as the rainfall could cause river swelling and rapid currents.

Firefighters in Ridgefield, Washington, rescued a man and his two daughters Saturday afternoon after their boat capsized in the Lewis River. The boat had struck a collection of trees in the river before it capsized. The man was able to hang on to his 8-year-old daughter after they were thrown into the water, but his 12-year-old daughter was sent downstream. All three were rescued from the river in stable condition. Rescue crews say the two girls were wearing flotation devices, which likely saved their lives.
