CORTEZ, Colo. — A pair of massive boulders rolled off a Colorado mountainside and smashed into a highway, destroying the pavement and leaving a house-sized rock across the roadway that will have to be blasted apart, state transportation officials said Saturday.

The highway is closed indefinitely, according to the San Miguel Sheriff, as crews removed unstable and loose rock to prevent another fall.

A photo posted by the City of Ouray showed a person posing in front of one of the boulders, which appeared as big as a two-story house. The other large boulder carved an 8-foot trench as it went over the roadway.

It’s relatively common for boulders and smaller rocks to fall on mountain highways, particularly in spring after the repeated melting and freezing of snow and ice creates new fissures on mountainsides.

But Friday’s afternoon rock slide along state Highway 145 between Cortez and Telluride was unusual in that it began about 1,000 feet above the highway , in a cliff band at the top of a slope leading down to the highway.

Once the slope above is deemed safe, crews will seek to build a shoulder along the damaged roadway so at least a single lane of traffic can be opened, Schwantes said.",pos,Cortez|Telluride|,Telluride,37.93580000000003,-107.84804999999994,0.708,"2019/05/24, 00:00-2019/05/24, 23:59

1,1,17,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-salmon-airlift-idUSKCN1UH2HU,Canada airlifting thousands of trapped migrating salmon upstream,2019-07-22 22:22:59+00:00,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is airlifting thousands of salmon upstream after a rockslide blocked the path of the migrating fish, triggering concerns of a permanent loss of fish populations, government officials said.

The Big Bar rockslide, which officials believe occurred in late October or early November 2018, is located in the Fraser River just north of the town of Lillooet in northern British Columbia. Because of the remoteness of the location, the slide was not discovered until late June 2019.

It created a waterfall which is preventing millions of chinook, steelhead, coho and sockeye salmon from swimming upstream to their habitual spawning grounds.

The provincial and federal governments are now working with local First Nations communities to move the salmon manually upstream, by creating holding ponds that will allow them to transport the fish via helicopter to a site further upstream.

“Collaborative efforts like this one, with all partners ... are crucial and will give the best chance of survival to these stocks,” Jonathan Wilkinson, federal minister of fisheries and oceans, said in a statement on Friday.

Other fish movement options being enacted are physically moving rocks from the slide to create a series of natural pools for the fish to rest in, and a fish transportation system of flexible pressurized tubes, the provincial government has said.

The fish will be monitored on their journey, including through blood samples taken to assess their energy reserves once they have passed the obstruction.

As the bodies of 59 people, who were buried alive in the landslide, are being retrieved one after the other since last Friday, their post-mortem is being conducted in the building of a nearby mosque. Masjid Al-Mujahidin mosque at Pothukal has opened its doors to the dead — to Hindus, Muslims and Christians. The mosque committee has handed over its premises used by women to offer namaz for conducting post-mortem of the victims.

Tying together writing tables at the madrasa, post-mortem tables have been readied. Since last Friday, the final journey of the victims, irrespective of their religion, has started from the compound of this mosque.

Pothukal panchayat member Sulaiman Haji said the nearest government hospital where post-mortem is conducted is in Nilambur, about 25 km from the village. “After the landslide and flood, it was very difficult to take all bodies to Nilambur. When officials wanted a place for post-mortem, we approached the mosque committee and they readily handed over its premises.’’

Mosque committee secretary Kareem Kavanaseri said, “Humanity is above everything, including religion. When officials sought for a place to conduct post-mortem, I showed them a room attached to the mosque. After a day, the doctors sought more space. Then we decided to hand over the halls where women offer namaz. We have also provided the facility for cleaning the bodies after they are retrieved,” said Kareem, who is also a trader.

The post-mortem proceedings also continued on Monday, when Eid was observed. Kareem said no one in the community had objected to the gesture. “In this hour of crisis, we can’t think anything else,’’ he said.

(WSPA) — North Carolina Department of Transportation announced Saturday that part of Interstate 40 in the mountains will remain closed for a week following a mudslide.

The slide happened Friday evening at mile marker 7.5 near the Tennessee state line.

UPDATE: Rockslide will keep I-40 in NC mountains closed until Saturday, officials say

“For everybody’s safety — drivers, workers, contractors — we need to keep the road closed for about a week,” Division 14 Engineer Brian Burch said. “At that point, we anticipate having enough material down the mountain that we can restore one lane of traffic in each direction.”

Traffic will be limited to one lane in each direction, on the eastbound side of a concrete median, for six to eight weeks, according to the release.

NC DOT said geotechnical experts surveyed the mountainside Saturday morning to find that debris was still falling.

The engineers determined that work will be required to stabilize the 500-foot wide area near Hurricane Creek.

UPDATE: Rockslide will keep I-40 in NC mountains closed until Saturday, officials say

According to a release, NC DOT awarded an emergency contract to Harrison Construction as part of another contract to improve I-40 later on this spring.

“Preliminary plans include removing approximately 27,000 cubic yards of dirt, rock and other debris, followed by the installation of preventative measures such as a netting or catchment fence. GeoTechnical experts will help develop the detailed plans,” NCDOT said in a release.

Drivers will need to plan for extra travel time.

NCDOT said the detour that utilizes a combination of I-40, I-240, I-26, and I-81 through Asheville and Johnson City is about 50 miles longer than driving through the Pigeon River Gorge.
