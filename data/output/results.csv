It was just after midnight when we got set upon.  We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path.  We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us.  Then we heard the footsteps.  Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat.  It all went to hell so fast.  Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there.  Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside.  The bastards were everywhere.  We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground.  They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers.  I couldn’t tell you if they were in the hundreds, but they felt like it.  My mount took a spear in the hindquarters and buckled.  I’ve never hit the ground so hard in my life.  Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me.  I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me.  He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.  

I went into a tree myself.  It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so.  The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat.  The tree had actually saved me twice over.  Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again.  Even through the tunnel vision, I could hear and feel the metal getting closed around my wrists, and even though I felt like I was about to die, I knew I wouldn’t, but that I would awaken enslaved.  They had shackles.  Shackles aren’t rope.  They aren’t multi-purpose.  They have a singular purpose, and that was my final lamenting thought as the tunnel of darkness closed in on me.  My head got weak, and fell into the mud.  The last sensation I can remember is the taste of blood and dirt in total, silent darkness.  

When I awoke, I couldn’t move.  I was in a pile of my brethren.  The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember.  Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again.  I was the only one awake.  Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back.  He felt cold, and his body never moved.  He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me.  Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower.  After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath.  The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.  

The next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water.  My lungs were so tired.  Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath.  Gods, all I wanted was air.   All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it.  There are moments that humble dwarves.  Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people.  All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier.  I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath.  I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled.  My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air.  My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under.  Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain.  That’s all there was.  In every incarnation.  

I felt one grab a handful of my hair, all the way down to the scalp and then yank.  Most of the hair held, quite a bit didn’t.  Fine shale sheered along my right side as he drug me onto the bank, then I watched as they grabbed another of my men from the wagon and heave him into the five foot deep center of the water that did indeed seem to flow down from the glacier atop the Marrowdwell Mountains above.  I couldn’t’ recognize him before they threw him.  We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.  

I think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud.  Never have I been more proud of my men.  There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs.  They simply rose, even then.  Because that’s what they do.  Hurrik, Lembrun, and Hassal.  I’m still trying to find them.  They came up to me and unfastened my shackles from behind me and when they saw my eyes begin looking around I saw the knives at my men’s throats.  There was nothing in their eyes.  Nothing.  Fucking good lads.  My hands were brought to my front and reshackled to match the others’.  

Four shackled dwarves, and nearly three dozen orc bastards in full arms.  My men all exchanged the same look.
