Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

The Kamrup Metropolitan district administration has urged people to leave their homes only if they have urgent or essential work.

Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha has issued an order ordering all schools, colleges and educational institutions to suspend classes in the wake of a rain alert issued by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC).

The RMC issued a ‘red alert’ for Assam and Meghalaya and forecast isolated and scattered ‘extremely heavy rain’ from Tuesday to Thursday, and ‘orange alert’ for Friday and Saturday.

A bulletin issued by the ASDMA said the flooding situation in several parts of the state is grim, with eight districts being inundated by rising waters in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries.

Dima Hasao Deputy Commissioner Nazreen Ahmed has issued an advisory asking people to restrict movement in public places.

The consultancy has urged people in vulnerable locations to go to the nearest notified shelters.

Nazreen Ahmed has issued another order ordering all educational institutions to remain closed until May 17, an official release said.

According to officials, levees, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have been damaged by flooding in Barpeta, Cachar, Chirang, Dhemaji and Goalpara, among others.

Meanwhile, state congress president Bhupen Boarh led a rally of party members here to protest the state government’s alleged apathy over the situation caused by flash floods in the ‘smart city’.

The protesters, who wade through knee-deep water, were stopped by police from continuing at a distance from the state party headquarters.

BEIJING -- Heavy rain in China has claimed six lives this week and forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people.

Five people died in southeastern China, according to state media reports: A house collapse took three lives in Fujian province on Tuesday, and two died Monday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in neighboring Jiangxi province.

One person died and three are missing in northern China after a vehicle fell into the water in mountain flooding from heavy rain in the Inner Mongolia region.

China regularly experiences seasonal rains and flooding during the summer, most frequently in central and southern areas.

Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed large parts of cities flooded in muddy waters. Rescue workers carried trapped people out of buildings on their backs in waist-deep water in Guangdong province, also in the southeast.

The rain ended Wednesday in Jiangxi, but more precipitation is forecast for another week in Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong and the nearby Guangxi region. The National Meteorological Center said residents should prepare for floods and landslides as the soil is already saturated in those areas.

More than 110,000 people have been relocated in Jiangxi province, along with more than 80,000 in Fujian, state media reports said.

Landslides involve the movement of a large mass of earth down a slope and they can be caused by various factors including poor soil structure, rainfall, drought, erosion, and seismic activities (earthquakes). An avalanche is the movement of large snow volumes.

What is the process of soil creep?

Soil creep is a very slow movement, occurring on very gentle slopes because of the way soil particles repeatedly expand and contract in wet and dry periods. When wet, soil particles increase in size and weight, and expand at right angles. … As a result, the soil slowly moves down slope.

Is landslide a calamity?

Landslides occur when ground on slopes becomes unstable. … Given the nature of such disasters, fast relief and rescue operations are required to get to trapped survivors but this can be delayed due to landslides cutting off easy access to the affected area.

What is soil creep?

Soil creep defines the slow mass wasting process of soil on a slope, under the influence of gravity (Source: Glossary of Soil Science terms, Soil Science Society of America). … It was also stated that the majority of rates of solifluction affected soil movement down to 50 cm of depth.

What is an example of a soil creep?

One example of soil creep in real life is from the wealthy Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tabogo. … The movement of the soil caused instability and triggered other, more dramatic forms of mass wasting such as debris flows, and the road required reconstruction to combat the one-inch-per-year creep in the area.

What causes creep movement?

Creep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward movement of slope-forming soil or rock. Movement is caused by shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too small to produce shear failure.

What are 4 types of landslides?

Landslides are part of a more general erosion or surficial pro- cess known as mass wasting, which is simply the downslope movement of earth or surface materials due to gravity. They are classified into four main types: fall and toppling, slides (rotational and translational), flows and creep.

What causes landslide?

Landslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris.

# UPDATE: Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

 

#### UPDATE: June 14 at 6:38 p.m.Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure; Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

**Updates**

* Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13, by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to multiple sections of road between the North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana), Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Cooke City, Montana, near the Northeast Entrance.
* Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.
* The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.
* To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.
* **All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED** while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.
* **There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.**
* The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend.
* Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.
* At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding. 
* Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.
* The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.
* Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

**Known damage** **and issues**

* Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes:  

   * North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon
   * Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees
   * Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road
   * Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation
* The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.
* Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.    

**Stay informed**

* Visitors planning to travel to Yellowstone in the upcoming weeks should stay informed about the current situation and pay close attention to the status of road and weather conditions.
* Stay informed about up-to-date road conditions in Yellowstone:
   * Visit [**Park Roads**](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/parkroads.htm).
   * To receive Yellowstone road alerts on your mobile phone, text “82190” to 888-777 (an automatic text reply will confirm receipt and provide instructions).
   * Call (307) 344-2117 for a recorded message.
* Find news releases about the incident on the park’s [**website**](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/newsreleases.htm).
* Find photos on [**Flickr**](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yellowstonenps/albums/72157668680150793) of this extremely hazardous situation in Yellowstone National Park.

It was just after midnight when we got set upon.  We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path.  We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us.  Then we heard the footsteps.  Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat.  It all went to hell so fast.  Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there.  Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside.  The bastards were everywhere.  We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground.  They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers.  I couldn’t tell you if they were in the hundreds, but they felt like it.  My mount took a spear in the hindquarters and buckled.  I’ve never hit the ground so hard in my life.  Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me.  I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me.  He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.  

I went into a tree myself.  It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so.  The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat.  The tree had actually saved me twice over.  Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again.  Even through the tunnel vision, I could hear and feel the metal getting closed around my wrists, and even though I felt like I was about to die, I knew I wouldn’t, but that I would awaken enslaved.  They had shackles.  Shackles aren’t rope.  They aren’t multi-purpose.  They have a singular purpose, and that was my final lamenting thought as the tunnel of darkness closed in on me.  My head got weak, and fell into the mud.  The last sensation I can remember is the taste of blood and dirt in total, silent darkness.  

When I awoke, I couldn’t move.  I was in a pile of my brethren.  The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember.  Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again.  I was the only one awake.  Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back.  He felt cold, and his body never moved.  He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me.  Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower.  After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath.  The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.  

The next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water.  My lungs were so tired.  Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath.  Gods, all I wanted was air.   All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it.  There are moments that humble dwarves.  Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people.  All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier.  I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath.  I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled.  My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air.  My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under.  Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain.  That’s all there was.  In every incarnation.  

I felt one grab a handful of my hair, all the way down to the scalp and then yank.  Most of the hair held, quite a bit didn’t.  Fine shale sheered along my right side as he drug me onto the bank, then I watched as they grabbed another of my men from the wagon and heave him into the five foot deep center of the water that did indeed seem to flow down from the glacier atop the Marrowdwell Mountains above.  I couldn’t’ recognize him before they threw him.  We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.  

I think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud.  Never have I been more proud of my men.  There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs.  They simply rose, even then.  Because that’s what they do.  Hurrik, Lembrun, and Hassal.  I’m still trying to find them.  They came up to me and unfastened my shackles from behind me and when they saw my eyes begin looking around I saw the knives at my men’s throats.  There was nothing in their eyes.  Nothing.  Fucking good lads.  My hands were brought to my front and reshackled to match the others’.  

Four shackled dwarves, and nearly three dozen orc bastards in full arms.  My men all exchanged the same look.

Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me. I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me. He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.

I went into a tree myself. It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so. The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat. The tree had actually saved me twice over. Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again.

When I awoke, I couldn’t move. I was in a pile of my brethren. The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember. Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again. I was the only one awake. Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back. He felt cold, and his body never moved. He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me. Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower. After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath. The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.

The next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water. My lungs were so tired. Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath. Gods, all I wanted was air. All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it. There are moments that humble dwarves. Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people. All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier. I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath. I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled. My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air. My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under. Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain.

We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.

I think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud. Never have I been more proud of my men. There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs.

It was just after midnight when we got set upon. We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path. We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us. Then we heard the footsteps. Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat. It all went to hell so fast. Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there. Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside. The bastards were everywhere. We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground. They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers.

UPDATE: June 18

Yellowstone National Park’s south loop will reopen to the public on June 22

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about the new interim visitor entry system



At 8 a.m. Wednesday, June 22, Yellowstone National Park will begin allowing visitors to access the south loop of the park. The south loop is accessed from the East (Cody), West (West Yellowstone), and South (Grand Teton/Jackson) entrances. Accessible areas include Madison, Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village and Norris. As part of reopening planning, park staff have engaged over 1,000 business owners, park partners, commercial operators and residents in surrounding gateway communities to determine how to manage summer visitation while the north loop remains closed due to flood damage.



To balance the demand for visitor access, park resource protection and economic interests of the communities, the park will institute an interim visitor access plan. The interim plan, referred to as the Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), was suggested as a solution by gateway communities during major public engagement with the park this past week. Park managers and partners have agreed this system is the best interim solution to ensuring the south loop does not become overwhelmed by visitors. The National Park Service will actively monitor the license plate system and is concurrently building a new reservation system that will be ready for implementation if needed.

Alternating License Plate System (ALPS)

Public vehicle entry will be allowed based on whether the last numerical digit on a license plate is odd or even.

Entrance will be granted based on odd/even days on the calendar. Odd-numbered last digits on license plates can enter on odd days of the month. Even-numbered last digits (including zero) on license plates can enter on even days of the month.

Personalized plates (all letters, for example ""YLWSTNE"") will fall into the “odd” category for entrance purposes.

Plates with a mix of letters and numbers but that end with a letter (for example ""YELL4EVR"") will still use the last numerical digit on the plate to determine entrance days.

Entrance station staff will turn away vehicles attempting to enter the park when the odd/even numerical digits do not correspond to the odd/even calendar date for entrance.

Exceptions

Current commercial use operators with active commercial use permits will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes commercial tours and stock groups.

Visitors with proof of overnight reservations in the park will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes hotels, campgrounds, and backcountry reservations.

Commercial motorcoaches will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number.

Motorcycle groups may enter on even dates only.

Essential services like mail and deliver, employees and contractors may enter regardless of license plate number.

The interim license plate system will ensure that visitors have access to the park during this period of high demand. Park managers and staff will monitor the license plate system and impacts on resources, infrastructure, operations, and staffing, and may adjust or implement a reservation or timed entry system, if necessary, after three to four weeks.



“Less than six days ago, Yellowstone National Park was hit with devastating floods,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams and partners, we are prepared to reopen the south loop of Yellowstone. It is impossible to reopen only one loop in the summer without implementing some type of system to manage visitation. My thanks to our gateway partners and others for helping us work out an acceptable temporary solution for the south loop while we continue our efforts to reopen the north loop. As we go through the reopening process, we will monitor the system’s effectiveness and work together to make adjustments that may be necessary. We will also reopen new sections of the park as repairs continue to be made. It is critical for visitors to stay informed about this interim system as we evaluate its effectiveness. They should plan ahead and be patient with us as we are still managing significant recovery while moving into this operational phase.”

OPEN in the south loop as of June 22

CLOSED until further notice in the south loop



Visit Operating Hours and Seasons for details about what is OPEN and CLOSED throughout the park.



Yellowstone staff are working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened prior to roads closing Nov. 1. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of park managers to safely open additional sections as the year progresses. Park managers are evaluating plans to reopen roads connecting Canyon Village, Tower Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris; however, this will not happen initially. The park is also working to reconnect Mammoth Hot Springs to Gardiner and Cooke City/Silver Gate as soon as possible with temporary solutions, while long-term reconstruction is planned.



Visitors should continue to monitor the park website and for additional updates.

UPDATE: June 17

Yellowstone National Park continues efforts to recover from historic flooding; Limited reopening highly possible next week on park’s south loop with certain visitor entrance modifications

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, changes in visitor entry requirements, and road and weather conditions

Key Information

Yellowstone continues major flood recovery efforts in the north while repairing damage and preparing for reopening in the south.

All five park entrances remain closed temporarily, however, West, South, and East entrances are targeted for reopening as early as next week.

Water levels remain high but have gone down substantially over the past 24 hours.

Weather patterns and potential for additional flooding events are being monitored with the assistance of NOAA and USGS personnel.

The National Park Service (NPS) has engaged over 1,000 partners in surrounding gateway communities, counties and states in the past 96 hours to brief on flood damage impacts and collaborate on reopening strategies.

Teams are in the park assessing damage and assisting with short and long-term recovery planning.

NPS is analyzing the carrying capacity of the south loop and working closely with partners to develop appropriate visitor management actions to safely accommodate visitors within that portion of the park.

NPS is working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened for the season. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of the NPS to safely open additional sections as the year progresses.

Although access to Yellowstone National Park will be less than normal until further notice, there are still incredible opportunities for recreation, wildlife viewing, and great experiences in the park’s gateway communities (Gardiner, Montana; Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana; West Yellowstone, Montana; Cody, Wyoming; and Jackson, Wyoming), as well as surrounding areas in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. View a list of nearby cities, parks, public lands, and museums to help plan your visit.

Visitors who have trips planned should continue to check the Yellowstone website, local chambers of commerce, and social media for updates to get the most up-to-date information.

Because initial damage assessments are ongoing, the NPS does not yet have an estimate on when Yellowstone will fully reopen nor are preliminary costs for repairs and recovery available.

To date, there have been no public or employee injuries reported due to the flood.

Message from the Superintendent

“We have made tremendous progress in a very short amount of time but have long way to go,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “All emergency and life safety objectives within the park have been accomplished or stabilized within the first 96 hours of the flood event, without major injury or death. We have an aggressive plan for recovery in the north and resumption of operations in the south. We appreciate the tremendous support from National Park Service and Department of the Interior leadership, in addition to our surrounding Congressional delegations, governors, counties, communities, and other partners. This first 96 hours has been critical to be able to focus on our life safety objectives and stabilizing emergency conditions while preparing plans for recovery.”

Objectives

North Loop (Primary Flood Recovery Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, community residents and partners Restore and maintain basic services including, power, water, and wastewater Restore temporary and permanent access between Yellowstone and Gardiner Restore temporary and permanent road access through the Northeast Entrance Road Restore access to the Yellowstone backcountry Engage communities, local, state, and federal stakeholders, and media

South Loop (Operations Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, and partners Repair damaged sections of roads and infrastructure in preparation of limited south loop reopening; inspect critical infrastructure (bridges, wastewater systems) Conduct extensive community outreach with gateways to identify and determine visitor use management actions necessary to host visitation on the south loop Develop reservation/timed entry system options for implementation with NPS visitor use experts Ensure internal business partners are prepared for visitor operations in the south loop Develop appropriate communications strategy on opening of south loop

General Updates

North Loop (Flood Recovery Zone)

All employees continue to be safe and accounted for. Additional support programs are being established for employees impacted by the flood event.

Employees who lost housing have been relocated to new housing units.

Thanks to Montana Department of Transportation and Park County Montana, Highway 89 north from Gardiner was reopened on Wednesday to facilitate the exit of stranded visitors.

Food and water supplies to Gardiner have resumed.

Power has been restored to Yellowstone with the assistance of Northwestern Energy.

Destroyed wastewater lines in Mammoth have been temporarily repaired with permanent repair options being planned.

Extensive efforts have been made to improve the Old Gardiner Road to help facilitate connection of essential services and personnel from Mammoth to Gardiner. Park staff are assessing what level of improvements are needed to facilitate higher traffic levels.

Plans and assessments of reconstruction of new the permanent road between Mammoth and Gardiner are underway. The new road will likely not be reconstructed in the same corridor as the previous road.

Teams from Federal Highways and other agencies are in the park assisting with damage assessments and assisting the park in developing cost estimates and timeline for repair.

Aerial 3D imaging flights have been conducted on the Northeast Entrance Road to Cooke City to help with damage assessments.

Extensive assessments are occurring of damage to trails, bridges and infrastructure within the Yellowstone backcountry.

Mud and rockslides have been cleared from Dunraven Pass and other sections of the northern and southern loops.

South Loop (Operations Zone)

The park intends to reopen the south loop sometime next week with new visitor management measures instituted (more information will be released soon). Reopening is dependent on damaged infrastructure being repaired.

On Thursday morning, June 16, a section of damaged road collapsed south of Canyon Village. Crews will begin major repairs on Friday, June 17 with an intent to complete repairs by Monday, June 20. This repair must be completed prior to opening the south loop.

Park staff are inspecting all bridges and roadways for damage on the south loop to facilitate safe travel.

To ensure the southern loop infrastructure is not overwhelmed, the park is working with gateway communities and NPS visitor use experts to determine the best way to facilitate access.

Known Damage and Issues

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13 by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to several park roads including: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide in Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction is compromised and collapsed overnight on June 15-16. Repairs are underway.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct or relocate and build.

In some cases, roads may not be able to be reconstructed in place and will need to be relocated.

The NPS will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible.

UPDATE: June 14

Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

Updates

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13, by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to multiple sections of road between the North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana), Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Cooke City, Montana, near the Northeast Entrance.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.

The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.

To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.

There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.

The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend (June 19).

Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.

At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.

Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.

Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

Known damage and issues

Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation

The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.

Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.

Statement from superintendent Cam Sholly about all entrances in Yellowstone National Park CLOSED temporarily due to heavy flooding, rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions

“Due to record flooding events in the park and more precipitation in the forecast, we have made the decision to close Yellowstone to all inbound visitation,"" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. ""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues. The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas. Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners. We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we're able to assess the damage throughout the park. It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time. I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event. We appreciate the support offered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.""

UPDATE: June 13, 2022 at 11:10 a.m.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park CLOSED temporarily due to heavy flooding, rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions

Stay informed about road status and weather conditions

Effective immediately, all entrances to Yellowstone National Park are temporarily CLOSED due to substantial flooding, rockslides and mudslides on roadways from recent unprecedented amounts of rainfall and flooding.

Effective immediately, no inbound visitor traffic will be allowed into the park until conditions stabilize and the park can assess damage to roads and bridges and other facilities. This includes visitors with lodging and camping reservations.

Closed entrances include: North Northeast West South East

The power is out in multiple locations in the park.

Visitors planning on coming to Yellowstone in the upcoming weeks should pay close attention to the status of road conditions.

Many park roads may remain closed for an extended period of time.

Preliminary assessments show multiple sections of roads throughout the park have been either washed out or covered in mud or rocks, and multiple bridges may be affected.

Multiple roads in the southern portion of the park are also on the verge of being flooded, further restricting access.

With additional rainfall forecasted, the park does not want large numbers of day-use visitors stranded in the park.

Strains on wastewater and water treatment facilities could become a factor and the park is taking precautions to ensure facilities are not failing.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and state of Montana and Wyoming will work with the gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide support to residents.

Rainfall is expected to continue for the next several days. Flood levels measured on the Yellowstone River are beyond record levels.

UPDATE: June 18

Yellowstone National Park’s south loop will reopen to the public on June 22

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about the new interim visitor entry system



At 8 a.m. Wednesday, June 22, Yellowstone National Park will begin allowing visitors to access the south loop of the park. The south loop is accessed from the East (Cody), West (West Yellowstone), and South (Grand Teton/Jackson) entrances. Accessible areas include Madison, Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village and Norris. As part of reopening planning, park staff have engaged over 1,000 business owners, park partners, commercial operators and residents in surrounding gateway communities to determine how to manage summer visitation while the north loop remains closed due to flood damage.



To balance the demand for visitor access, park resource protection and economic interests of the communities, the park will institute an interim visitor access plan. The interim plan, referred to as the Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), was suggested as a solution by gateway communities during major public engagement with the park this past week. Park managers and partners have agreed this system is the best interim solution to ensuring the south loop does not become overwhelmed by visitors. The National Park Service will actively monitor the license plate system and is concurrently building a new reservation system that will be ready for implementation if needed.

Alternating License Plate System (ALPS)

Public vehicle entry will be allowed based on whether the last numerical digit on a license plate is odd or even.

Entrance will be granted based on odd/even days on the calendar. Odd-numbered last digits on license plates can enter on odd days of the month. Even-numbered last digits (including zero) on license plates can enter on even days of the month.

Personalized plates (all letters, for example ""YLWSTNE"") will fall into the “odd” category for entrance purposes.

Plates with a mix of letters and numbers but that end with a letter (for example ""YELL4EVR"") will still use the last numerical digit on the plate to determine entrance days.

Entrance station staff will turn away vehicles attempting to enter the park when the odd/even numerical digits do not correspond to the odd/even calendar date for entrance.

Exceptions

Current commercial use operators with active commercial use permits will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes commercial tours and stock groups.

Visitors with proof of overnight reservations in the park will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes hotels, campgrounds, and backcountry reservations.

Commercial motorcoaches will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number.

Motorcycle groups may enter on even dates only.

Essential services like mail and deliver, employees and contractors may enter regardless of license plate number.

The interim license plate system will ensure that visitors have access to the park during this period of high demand. Park managers and staff will monitor the license plate system and impacts on resources, infrastructure, operations, and staffing, and may adjust or implement a reservation or timed entry system, if necessary, after three to four weeks.



“Less than six days ago, Yellowstone National Park was hit with devastating floods,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams and partners, we are prepared to reopen the south loop of Yellowstone. It is impossible to reopen only one loop in the summer without implementing some type of system to manage visitation. My thanks to our gateway partners and others for helping us work out an acceptable temporary solution for the south loop while we continue our efforts to reopen the north loop. As we go through the reopening process, we will monitor the system’s effectiveness and work together to make adjustments that may be necessary. We will also reopen new sections of the park as repairs continue to be made. It is critical for visitors to stay informed about this interim system as we evaluate its effectiveness. They should plan ahead and be patient with us as we are still managing significant recovery while moving into this operational phase.”

OPEN in the south loop as of June 22

CLOSED until further notice in the south loop



Visit Operating Hours and Seasons for details about what is OPEN and CLOSED throughout the park.



Yellowstone staff are working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened prior to roads closing Nov. 1. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of park managers to safely open additional sections as the year progresses. Park managers are evaluating plans to reopen roads connecting Canyon Village, Tower Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris; however, this will not happen initially. The park is also working to reconnect Mammoth Hot Springs to Gardiner and Cooke City/Silver Gate as soon as possible with temporary solutions, while long-term reconstruction is planned.



Visitors should continue to monitor the park website and for additional updates.

UPDATE: June 17

Yellowstone National Park continues efforts to recover from historic flooding; Limited reopening highly possible next week on park’s south loop with certain visitor entrance modifications

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, changes in visitor entry requirements, and road and weather conditions

Key Information

Yellowstone continues major flood recovery efforts in the north while repairing damage and preparing for reopening in the south.

All five park entrances remain closed temporarily, however, West, South, and East entrances are targeted for reopening as early as next week.

Water levels remain high but have gone down substantially over the past 24 hours.

Weather patterns and potential for additional flooding events are being monitored with the assistance of NOAA and USGS personnel.

The National Park Service (NPS) has engaged over 1,000 partners in surrounding gateway communities, counties and states in the past 96 hours to brief on flood damage impacts and collaborate on reopening strategies.

Teams are in the park assessing damage and assisting with short and long-term recovery planning.

NPS is analyzing the carrying capacity of the south loop and working closely with partners to develop appropriate visitor management actions to safely accommodate visitors within that portion of the park.

NPS is working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened for the season. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of the NPS to safely open additional sections as the year progresses.

Although access to Yellowstone National Park will be less than normal until further notice, there are still incredible opportunities for recreation, wildlife viewing, and great experiences in the park’s gateway communities (Gardiner, Montana; Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana; West Yellowstone, Montana; Cody, Wyoming; and Jackson, Wyoming), as well as surrounding areas in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. View a list of nearby cities, parks, public lands, and museums to help plan your visit.

Visitors who have trips planned should continue to check the Yellowstone website, local chambers of commerce, and social media for updates to get the most up-to-date information.

Because initial damage assessments are ongoing, the NPS does not yet have an estimate on when Yellowstone will fully reopen nor are preliminary costs for repairs and recovery available.

To date, there have been no public or employee injuries reported due to the flood.

Message from the Superintendent

“We have made tremendous progress in a very short amount of time but have long way to go,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “All emergency and life safety objectives within the park have been accomplished or stabilized within the first 96 hours of the flood event, without major injury or death. We have an aggressive plan for recovery in the north and resumption of operations in the south. We appreciate the tremendous support from National Park Service and Department of the Interior leadership, in addition to our surrounding Congressional delegations, governors, counties, communities, and other partners. This first 96 hours has been critical to be able to focus on our life safety objectives and stabilizing emergency conditions while preparing plans for recovery.”

Objectives

North Loop (Primary Flood Recovery Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, community residents and partners Restore and maintain basic services including, power, water, and wastewater Restore temporary and permanent access between Yellowstone and Gardiner Restore temporary and permanent road access through the Northeast Entrance Road Restore access to the Yellowstone backcountry Engage communities, local, state, and federal stakeholders, and media

South Loop (Operations Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, and partners Repair damaged sections of roads and infrastructure in preparation of limited south loop reopening; inspect critical infrastructure (bridges, wastewater systems) Conduct extensive community outreach with gateways to identify and determine visitor use management actions necessary to host visitation on the south loop Develop reservation/timed entry system options for implementation with NPS visitor use experts Ensure internal business partners are prepared for visitor operations in the south loop Develop appropriate communications strategy on opening of south loop

General Updates

North Loop (Flood Recovery Zone)

All employees continue to be safe and accounted for. Additional support programs are being established for employees impacted by the flood event.

Employees who lost housing have been relocated to new housing units.

Thanks to Montana Department of Transportation and Park County Montana, Highway 89 north from Gardiner was reopened on Wednesday to facilitate the exit of stranded visitors.

Food and water supplies to Gardiner have resumed.

Power has been restored to Yellowstone with the assistance of Northwestern Energy.

Destroyed wastewater lines in Mammoth have been temporarily repaired with permanent repair options being planned.

Extensive efforts have been made to improve the Old Gardiner Road to help facilitate connection of essential services and personnel from Mammoth to Gardiner. Park staff are assessing what level of improvements are needed to facilitate higher traffic levels.

Plans and assessments of reconstruction of new the permanent road between Mammoth and Gardiner are underway. The new road will likely not be reconstructed in the same corridor as the previous road.

Teams from Federal Highways and other agencies are in the park assisting with damage assessments and assisting the park in developing cost estimates and timeline for repair.

Aerial 3D imaging flights have been conducted on the Northeast Entrance Road to Cooke City to help with damage assessments.

Extensive assessments are occurring of damage to trails, bridges and infrastructure within the Yellowstone backcountry.

Mud and rockslides have been cleared from Dunraven Pass and other sections of the northern and southern loops.

South Loop (Operations Zone)

The park intends to reopen the south loop sometime next week with new visitor management measures instituted (more information will be released soon). Reopening is dependent on damaged infrastructure being repaired.

On Thursday morning, June 16, a section of damaged road collapsed south of Canyon Village. Crews will begin major repairs on Friday, June 17 with an intent to complete repairs by Monday, June 20. This repair must be completed prior to opening the south loop.

Park staff are inspecting all bridges and roadways for damage on the south loop to facilitate safe travel.

To ensure the southern loop infrastructure is not overwhelmed, the park is working with gateway communities and NPS visitor use experts to determine the best way to facilitate access.

Known Damage and Issues

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13 by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to several park roads including: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide in Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction is compromised and collapsed overnight on June 15-16. Repairs are underway.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct or relocate and build.

In some cases, roads may not be able to be reconstructed in place and will need to be relocated.

The NPS will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible.

UPDATE: June 14

Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

Updates

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13, by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to multiple sections of road between the North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana), Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Cooke City, Montana, near the Northeast Entrance.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.

The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.

To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.

There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.

The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend (June 19).

Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.

At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.

Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.

Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

Known damage and issues

Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation

The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.

Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.

(CNN) — Yellowstone National Park announced Monday all entrances are temporarily closed due to ""extremely hazardous conditions"" caused by ""unprecedented"" rainfall and flooding.

""Effective immediately, all entrances to Yellowstone National Park are temporarily CLOSED due to substantial flooding, rockslides and mudslides on roadways from recent unprecedented amounts of rainfall and flooding,"" the park said in a Facebook post

No inbound traffic is allowed ""until the conditions stabilize and the park can assess damage to roads and bridges,"" the post added. The North, Northeast, West, South and East entrances are all closed.

The park posted a situation update on its website Monday afternoon saying that no inbound visitor traffic would be allowed on Tuesday or Wednesday ""at a minimum.""

""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues,"" superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement.

Visitors will be evacuated from the southern loop of the park starting later on Monday due to anticipated higher flood levels and concerns with water and wastewater systems, the statement said.

The northern loop is likely to be closed ""for a substantial amount of time,"" and the park's reopening will be determined after flood waters recede and damage is assessed.

Park staff is working with the county and state to provide support to residents of Gardiner, Montana, a town just north of the park that is currently isolated by the dangerous conditions, the statement said.

Multiple portions of the park are also experiencing power outages, the park said in its postings.

""With additional rainfall forecasted, the park does not want large numbers of day-use visitors stranded in the park,"" the park said on Facebook and its website.

According to National Park Service data from 2014 to 2018, more than 780,000 people typically visit the park in June.

""The river has never been this high before by my house,"" said Elizabeth Aluck, a resident of Gardiner, which serves as a gateway for visitors.

As of Monday afternoon, Aluck said she was unable to evacuate because roads and bridges in the area are washed out.

Travelers with plans to visit Yellowstone National Park in the coming weeks should monitor road conditions , the park advised.

'Things have gotten rougher'

A family staying at a short-term rental house in Gardiner near the park entrance is now unable to leave their rental cabin due to flooding in the area.

Indiana couple Melissa and Parker Manning told CNN they arrived at their rental on Saturday with their family, and expected to leave Monday morning.

""That's not happening any time soon,"" Parker Manning said. ""The water levels were high on Saturday but within the past 10-12 hours things have gotten rougher.""

The couple joined a call with emergency management officials Monday afternoon. Officials on the call suggested local businesses consider food rationing, just in case.

Manning said they did go to the grocery store, and everyone was being smart about what to stock up on and not panicking.

""Our way out of town would be north on 89, but those roads are currently all underwater,"" Manning said.

The couple has no idea when they will be able to leave the town, but Manning hopes it will be within the next 48 hours.

The host of their rental was very understandable of the situation, Manning added.

Avoid streams and creeks

Earlier Monday, the park said in a news release roads in the northern portion of the park would be temporarily closed for ""an extended period of time"" before posting the wider closure.

""Preliminary assessments show multiple sections of road in the park have been washed out between Gardiner and Cooke City, Montana, and multiple bridges may be affected,"" the release said, adding visitors in the northern portion are being evacuated.

The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the park on Monday and advised campers and hikers to avoid streams and creeks.

""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads,"" the NWS cautioned those in vehicles.

Mammoth, Osprey Falls, Indian Creek Campground and Lava Creek Campgrounds, all located in the park, are locations expected to experience floods, the weather service said.

The Yellowstone River reached record-high levels Monday in the Montana towns of Corwin Springs and Livingston.

At Corwin Springs, the river rose more than 5 feet on Monday morning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration river gauge data. The gauge reading was 13.85 feet on Monday afternoon, surpassing the historical high crest of 11.5 feet from 1918.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park were closed Monday and would be through at least Wednesday as heavy rain falling on melting snow caused significant flooding and road damage, park officials announced.

Calling it “extremely hazardous conditions,” authorities evacuated the northern portion of the park due to flooding, rockslides and mudslides caused by record rainfall.

Park officials announced on Monday afternoon that the park would be closed to visitors until at least Wednesday.

“Red Lodge, Montana, is a river right now and we have some flooding on the west of Cody,” Cody Beers, a Wyoming Department of Transportation spokesman, told Cowboy State Daily. “I’ve never heard of Yellowstone closing the entire park to inbound traffic, though.”

Footage from the storms showed roads collapsing into raging rivers and logs piled high on the shores.

The electricity was out in several areas of the park as of Monday morning.

All inbound traffic to the park was halted until conditions stabilized and park officials could assess damage to the roads, bridges and other facilities. The visitors turned away included those with lodging and camping reservations.

Many of the park roads could be closed for an extended period of time, according to park officials.

“It’s just been multiple days of rain up in this area, plus we had snow on Memorial Day weekend,” Beers said. “It’s a rare day when we have water levels that reached the bottom of our bridges.”

Cowboy State Daily meteorologist Don Day said flood advisories surround Yellowstone because of the “huge amount of snow” coupled with the significant rain.

“I don’t think anyone thought the runoff would be as big as this,” he said.

Beers said WYDOT will continue to monitor the weather events in the northwestern portion of the state and how they might affect roads.

He recommended anyone traveling toward Yellowstone wait a day or two for officials to figure out how long certain roads will be closed and whether the rainfall in the area will continue.

“Be careful out there, because Mother Nature’s fury is showing itself right now,” Beers said.

Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly said on Monday that staff’s first priority was to evacuate the northern section of the park, where there were multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues.

“The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,” Sholly said. “Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners.”

Sholly said it was likely the northern loop of the park would be closed for a substantial amount of time.

“I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event,” he said. “We appreciate the support offered by the Department of Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.”

GARDINER, Mont. – Yellowstone National Park officials assessed widespread damage Tuesday as the park remained closed amid dangerous floods, mudslides and rockslides that have eroded roads, ripped apart bridges and forced evacuations this week.

The water started to slowly recede Tuesday and one key highway reopened, but the record-level floods left all five entrances to the park closed through at least Wednesday, officials said. And, officials said during an update on Tuesday, the water levels could still change at any time.

“The water is still raging,” said Park Superintendent Cam Sholly, who added that more wet weather was forecast this weekend, which could cause additional flooding.

The park, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, has seen multiple road and bridge failures, power outages and mudslides, causing the evacuations of more than 10,000 visitors from the park.

“I’ve never seen this, not in my lifetime,” said Austin King, a firefighter and EMT in Gardiner, a town just outside Yellowstone's busy northern entrance.

There were no reports of injuries or deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, but floodwaters swept away a number of homes, bridges and other structures. The northern part of the park suffered the worst damage.

The full scope of the damage was not known Tuesday, leaving it unclear when roads might reopen or when residents in neighboring communities might be able to return.

The northern loop of Yellowstone National Park was cleared of visitors and park officials were working to evacuate visitors in the southern area of the park Tuesday. Park staff were searching for five back-country groups to ensure they were safely evacuated.

Meanwhile, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster and said the Montana National Guard rescued 12 people stranded by high waters in Roscoe and Cooke City.

Highways reopen as floodwaters recede

The Yellowstone River reached highs of almost 14 feet on Monday, far higher than the record 11.5 feet set more than a century ago, according the the National Weather Service.

Although the water was still ""extremely"" high, a route out of Gardiner, a town of about 900 people, reopened Tuesday afternoon, according to county Commissioner Bill Berg and Sholly.

Visitors could drive out using U.S. Highway 89 and East River Road, but only residents and service vehicles were allowed to drive back inside. While some residents questioned if they could wait a few days before leaving town, Berg and Sholly were adamant: “Get out of Gardiner.”

""We are working with the county and state of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,"" Yellowstone officials said Monday.

A smaller highway into the previously isolated Cooke City also reopened to local traffic and emergency services Tuesday afternoon.

Yellowstone communities left stranded, without power

The flooding left some of Yellowstone's small gateway communities in southern Montana isolated and without power, leading to evacuations by boat and helicopter.

Floodwaters isolated areas including Silvergate, which is east of the park, and led to evacuations in Livingston. As Stillwater River in south-central Montana flooded, 68 people were stranded at a campground as crews rescued campers by raft.

Officials in Park County, which encompasses those cities, issued shelter-in-place orders Monday and warned flooding had made drinking water unsafe in many communities. Residents hauled bottled water home from stores and worried about a possible food shortage.

Many in Gardiner have used only bottled water to brush their teeth, wash dishes and prepare food due to a break in the area's main water service line. The community was under an advisory to boil water before consumption as of Tuesday afternoon.

The county said water and air rescues were underway amid evacuations Monday.

""Extensive flooding throughout Park County has washed out bridges, roads, and left communities and homes isolated,"" Park County said in a statement.

A 10-person bunker was among the buildings that slipped from the riverbank into the water. Only a portion of the building's foundation remained Tuesday.

Parker Manning, who was visiting from Terre Haute, Indiana, watched the flooding from a cabin in Gardiner. He said he saw trees and a mostly intact house floating in rushing waters.

In the south-central Montana town of Joliet, Kristan Apodaca cried as she watched floodwaters overtake her grandmother's log cabin and the park where her husband proposed.

""I am sixth-generation,"" she told the Billings Gazette. ""This is our home.""

King, the EMT in Gardiner, said the flooding was ""damaging for a lot of people.""

""Some have lost their houses; others can’t go to work,"" King said. ""People are worried about food shortages already.""

When will Yellowstone reopen?

Yellowstone officials have prohibited visitors from entering the park at any of its five entrances until at least Wednesday.

Sholly said the park could remain closed as long as a week, and northern entrances may not reopen at all this summer.

Cory Mottice, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Billings, Montana, said reduced rain and cooler temperatures, which could lead to decreased snowmelt, may lessen flooding.

Still, ""this is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,"" Mottice said.

Why is Yellowstone flooding?

Record rainfall combined with rapidly melting snowpack caused the deluge of flooding this week. Scientists pointed to climate change as the culprit behind more intense and frequent weather events.

The flooding happened as the summer tourist season was ramping up. June is one of the park's busiest months.

What state is Yellowstone National Park in?

The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park encompasses nearly 3,500 square miles on top of a volcanic hot spot. The park lies mostly in Wyoming but spreads into Montana and Idaho.

The park allows visitors ""to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River,"" according to the Yellowstone's website.

Visitors to Yellowstone National Park were seen narrowly escaping with their lives after a rockslide began falling on their vehicle amid devastating floods.

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

Additional reporting by the Associated Press.",Video shows Yellowstone visitors narrowly missing rockfall amid flood devastation,[],2022-06-15 19:29:40+00:00,,"Visitors to Yellowstone National Park were seen narrowly escaping with their lives after a rockslide began falling on their vehicle amid devastating floods.

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Helena, Mon. (NEXSTAR) —On Monday, a deluge wiped out at least one bridge, washed away roads, and caused a landslide in Yellowstone National Park.

Authorities closed all five entrances, began evacuating visitors from the northern part of the park, and warned that the park was temporarily closed due to a “very dangerous situation.”

Park officials said roads to and from the Gardiner community in Montana, just north of the park, were impassable. Kam Sholy said the loop on the north side of the park could be closed for quite some time.

Park officials planned to evacuate visitors from the park’s South Loop on Monday afternoon. This is because more rain is expected.

Higher levels of flood forecasts prompted the decision, along with concerns about water and wastewater, according to Shory.

Agartala: The incessant rains across the Northeast are now putting pressure on states like Tripura, Mizoram and Barak valley, as the road considered the lifeline for these regions—the National Highway 6—witnessed several landslides, especially in Meghalaya.

Tripura, for now, seems to be the worst hit due to the disruptions across National Highway 6. Higher officials of the food and civil supplies department said if the road connectivity is restored within a few days, there would be no major effect. However, if the traffic remains disrupted for the long term, a crisis may hit the state markets. “The present stock of food grains is enough for this month. Earlier, large quantities of rice and other essential grains could be transported through railways. In absence of railway services, we are largely dependent on roadways. And definitely, the supply chain needs to remain unaffected when we have only one route operational,” Saradindu Chowdhury, secretary, Tripura Food and Civil Supplies department told EastMojo.

Railway services were snapped after heavy rains triggered landslides and inundated Haflong railway station. Expectedly, the railway operations are slated to resume on July 10. “As per the reports we have received from the National Highway Authorities, the road will be restored within the next two to three days. We are in constant touch with the highway authorities and accordingly, steps will be undertaken,” principal secretary, transport department told EastMojo.

However, as per the sources in the food and civil supplies department, the state has a stock of essential food grains for the next ten to fifteen days while the stock of petroleum oil is enough for the next eight to ten days. “The alternative Guwahati-Agartala route through Bangladesh is still operational and IOCL is transporting gas bullets frequently. If the road connectivity also gets halted for a long time, we would be compelled to depend on the transport route through Bangladesh for transit of essentials,” said a top source in the department.

Mizoram, on the other hand, seems prepared for the floods better than Tripura. For now, according to people EastMojo spoke with, the state has essentials thanks to the road between Silchar and Aizawl which is still functioning. However, if the NH-6 remains out of commission, it will put much more pressure on the state, especially for fuel needs. Petrol pumps across the state witnessed more activity than usual, however, and late on Thursday evening, the state government issued a directive limiting how much petrol a vehicle can buy. According to the state directive, a two-wheeler scooter can buy 3 litres of petrol at a time, while a motorcycle can buy up to 5 litre at a time. The limit for light motor vehicles (cars) is 10 litres, and heavy motor vehicles can buy up to 40 litres at a time. The orders are effective from June 16.

MONTREAL - The Quebec government was preparing Monday to extend a local state of emergency to a neighbourhood in Saguenay, Que., north of Quebec City, after almost 200 people were recently forced from their homes due to a threat of landslides.

About 187 residents had to relocate from the La Baie district after a landslide destroyed a house last week. Dominic Arseneau, a spokesperson for the city of Saguenay, said the city declared a local state of emergency Saturday night and planned to make an official request Monday evening to the province to extend it.

The evacuated area, Arseneau said in an interview, remains unstable and other landslides are “imminent and inevitable.”

“We know it’s going to happen, we just don’t know when,” he added.

Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault told reporters Monday she was waiting on the official request from the city before signing the state of emergency order. She said the declaration would allow Saguenay to sidestep the usual paperwork and more easily requisition property, sign contracts and redirect traffic.

“We need a good reason to declare state of emergency, but it’s rare that a municipality will ask for it if they don’t need to,” Guilbault said.

Arseneau said emergency levees have been erected in the affected part of the city to avoid any more displacement and to stop debris and mud from sliding further into the area.

Several groups have offered to shelter displaced families, most of whom had a few hours to pack their belongings and didn’t know whether they would be able to return to their homes.

Marie-Chantale Tremblay says she called her mother, 57, and stepfather, 66, slightly before 10 p.m. on Saturday after seeing on social media that people were evacuating the La Baie neighbourhood.

“My mom didn’t believe it at first, but everything happened so quickly,” Tremblay said Monday in an interview. “We tried to take as much as we could … They left their home, the memories behind.”

Contact Nature, a non-profit that owns two campgrounds in La Baie, is one of the groups that have offered to provide free accommodation to the families affected by the landslides. Its CEO, Marc-André Galbrand, says that five families, including Tremblay’s, have contacted him.

“There are no words; we are devastated like everyone else by what is happening,” Galbrand said in an interview Monday. “We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible.”

Meanwhile, residents were scheduled to meet on Monday with government officials about the different types of assistance programs available to people who are searching for emergency accommodation. Each person who was forced from their home will receive $20 a day for living expenses, the public security department said.

Quebec is also offering $260,000 to those who won’t be able to return to their homes, Guilbault said.

“The city of Saguenay suffered a lot in the past,” she said about the natural disasters that have hit the city. “Right now, people are very proactive because of it, but at one point, people are fed up. We will be there; we know it’s difficult.”

Didier Perret, a research scientist with Natural Resources Canada who has been studying landslides in the Saguenay area since 1996, says the region is known for its unstable clay soil. The city, Perret added, meets a lot of the criteria for landslides.

The affected district is located on a hill with a steep incline, and recent heavy rains have made the soil particularly unstable, he said.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, Que., also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a major landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people. In 1996, the Chicoutimi River flooded, triggering landslides and causing damage that killed at least 10 people, forcing thousands from their homes.

“Those events are still remembered,” Perret said. “When landslides happen, it brings back bad memories.”

MONTREAL - Almost 200 people in Saguenay, Que., have been forced to leave their homes and belongings behind as the area faces a high risk of a landslide.

City officials declared a state of emergency on Saturday and asked inhabitants of 53 homes in the borough of La Baie to evacuate before 7 a.m. Sunday.

The order came after 21 households were evacuated in the region north of Quebec City earlier this week, following a landslide that swept away an empty house on Monday.

Saguenay Mayor Julie Dufour told reporters Sunday that families forced to flee could be out of their homes for weeks or even months. She said they’d get help from the city to relocate.

“As the mayor, it warms my heart that everybody is alive,” Dufour said. “We were able to avoid a disaster.”

Officials said the ground underneath the evacuated area is unstable and it could lead to a massive landslide similar to the Saint-Jean-Vianney disaster.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a gigantic landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people.

“Right now, everything is possible,” Dufour said, warning against scaring residents with such a comparison.

“Are there going to be houses that aren’t going to be able to remain there? Homes that will stay but with stabilizing renovation? Others without? It’s too early to say.”

The priority is to evacuate as fast as possible, said Saguenay Fire Department Chief Carol Girard at a Sunday press conference.

While the risk of a landslide was “imminent,” he said more ground analysis is needed in the upcoming days to determine whether additional people need to be displaced.

Andree Laforest, Quebec municipal affairs minister, said at the same press conference that Geneviève Guilbault, the provincial public security minister, was considering whether the province would also declare a state of emergency.

In the meantime, 30 homes were made available for evacuated residents and support and accommodation services were put in place with the Red Cross, the Saguenay, and the public security ministry, Laforest added.

Camping sites have offered accommodation, along with seniors’ residences and other places might be made available in the future, she said.

“It’s a shock, but residents can see we avoided the worst.”

Heavy rains across the Pacific Northwest spurred concerns about minor flooding and landslides in parts of Oregon.

Federal water managers are increasing water storage behind the John Day Dam in northeastern Oregon to help with water levels further down the Columbia River Basin.

“This precipitation has fallen on our mountain snowpack which has added even more water into our river systems,” said Steve Barton of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a press release.

Barton said several points throughout the basin will reach flood stage.

“Of primary concern to us at this point is public safety,” he said. “This system of dams was built primarily to protect the public from catastrophic floods. While we cannot prevent all flooding, we can take steps to minimize the impacts of these powerful weather events.”

Rising water levels in the Willamette River closed a portion of Portland’s popular multi-use path, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, from the Morrison Bridge to the Steel Bridge. City officials say it could remain closed for several days. The river is expected to rise to 15.5 feet.

The Columbia River also rose over the weekend, reaching 15.6 feet by mid-Sunday. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning along the river from Vancouver to Longview.

Flood stage in Vancouver is 16 feet (4.87 meters), and forecasters say river levels will approach that level repeatedly through late Wednesday morning. At 16 feet, minor flooding occurs, affecting islands and low-lying areas, with minor impacts on parks or trails along the river, according to the National Weather Service.

The NWS also issued a flood watch for much of northeastern Oregon through Sunday night. Officials warned people to be on the lookout for potential landslides.

Landslides can occur near steep terrain, especially near burned areas from recent wildfires, and they can move faster than a person can run.

Emergency officials are warning swimmers to stay away from local rivers in the coming days, as the rainfall could cause river swelling and rapid currents.

Firefighters in Ridgefield, Washington, rescued a man and his two daughters Saturday afternoon after their boat capsized in the Lewis River. The boat had struck a collection of trees in the river before it capsized. The man was able to hang on to his 8-year-old daughter after they were thrown into the water, but his 12-year-old daughter was sent downstream. All three were rescued from the river in stable condition. Rescue crews say the two girls were wearing flotation devices, which likely saved their lives.

Heavy rain between April and June has already made it the wettest year for that period on record since 1940, according to NWS Portland.

**“So you’re just going to leave, then?”** Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”

Avians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.

Poire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.

Now, those siblings were running away. Most of them were avian, but Poire spotted one creature with bulging yellow eyes and green, leathery scales wearing a priest’s walking clothes. Some were rushing. Others tried to move with a quiet dignity, as if they thought they were doing the right thing.

“Where are you going to go, then?” Muqwa shouted at the throngs. He pointed at one red-feathered avian. “Sister Inakah, what are you going to do?”

“Survive,” Inakah said. She was just as old and round as Muqwa. “At least, I hope to. And if you know better, you will leave too, Muqwa.”

“What about the Oracle? What about our order?”

“The Oracle is silent, as always.”

She was already walking away.

“Brother Osul,” Muqwa called to another avian, who was carrying a bulging knapsack over his shoulder. Silver and other precious metals glinted out of the top. “Are those from the temple? Are you *stealing from the gods*?”

“Mind your own roost, Muqwa. The gods help those who help themselves.”

Muqwa opened his mouth to argue when Poire tugged at his robes. Reminding him of their purpose.

But Muqwa was too worked up. His jowls quivered with fury. “You call yourselves faithful. Pwah! Faith would have you here to protect our sacred home from these ransacking cyrans. What if the Savior returns? *Where will you be?*”

One or two of the priests stopped long enough to look back at Muqwa, at the temple and the tower. But they would not change their minds. The fire over the Midcity was growing taller. The clouds, blacker.

Brother Osul, on the other hand, was still standing there, his brow feathers cocked high.

“Who’s this?” Osul nodded at Poire.

“A lost fledgling, that’s all.”

Osul stared.

Muqwa put a protective hand out, pushing Poire behind him. “I found him on my way from the garden.”

But the answer didn’t seem to satisfy Osul. Poire could feel the brother’s gaze lingering on his robes, searching for his face beneath the shadow of his hood. Poire shifted uncomfortably, and even his armor began to stir again somewhere beneath his clothes. He pulled his hood tighter over his face.

There was a shout behind them. A patrol of cyrans were shoving one of the priests around, pulling a knapsack off her shoulders and dumping its contents onto the ground. She threw up her hands, letting them take it, letting them tear through the books and papers.

“Quickly,” Muqwa whispered to Poire, turning him away from Osul, “let’s get inside before anyone sees you.”

The easternmost tower, just like the leaning tower, was not how Poire remembered it. Huge stone walls had been constructed around the tower, completely walling in the central pylon. Still, the tower was unmistakable. It soared hundreds of feet above the other buildings.

Arches ringed the base of the tower, forming dozens of entrances to the inner monastery.

Muqwa went in first to make sure that it was clear to enter. And then, he beckoned Poire to follow.

Inside, the sound of the world changed. Footsteps became shuffling echoes, and every breath sounded like the rumbling earth. Torches and pockets filled with candles lit the dusky atrium. There was a kind of excitement in the priest’s gait as he led them down a set of steep, seastone steps that curved around the center of the tower.

“Right this way. And watch the stairs, they’re sharp.”

The steps were cramped and worn smooth from centuries of use; Poire’s feet wanted to slip on them. Candles and torches were replaced by gaslights encased in fragile, cloudy glass. A glow ushered in shadows from below.

Here, the lights numbered in the hundreds. A cavernous basement stretched as far as he could see, filled to brimming with the steady warmth of lanterns and the glint of gold. Precious metals had been crafted into symbols of the Faith that hung on the walls and the heavy, stone columns. Color had been worked into the stones so that the polished floor was one enormous mural.

The smell of natural gas was so rich it was hard to think. All Poire could hear was the hissing of fuel flowing through a network of pipes that crawled across the corners of the floor.

The ceilings were covered with paintings, flecked and peeling. Each one showed another scene, often of human beings. Sometimes they were tending to plants or feeding animals. This one was a woman whispering into the ear of a bird. Here was a man reaching into the water where a scaled hand rose up to meet his. And directly above Poire was a human sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, a whole forest of trees growing out of his flesh. Each scene was a new masterpiece.

*They built all this? Burning gas to see and carving with such crude tools?*

There was a gleam of metal from the center of the temple. One of eight pylons, built by humans so long ago. The pylon held up all this stone, just like it once held something else.

But Muqwa drew his attention to an altar covered with a pale linen cloth. Gold stitching embroidered the cloth in an intricate pattern.

“There it is.” Muqwa bowed at the altar. “The Oracle.”

“It’s a control panel.”

“Hmm?” Muqwa said.

But how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.

*Maybe it still has power,* Poire thought.

“It looks like it needs maintenance.”

“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”

“Since when do control panels give instructions?”

“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”

“You think?”

“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed *yet*. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”

“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.

“Yes?”

He hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”

“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.

Poire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?

*What can you possibly see in me?*

Beyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.

Judging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.

“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.

“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”

Muqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.

“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.

This time, Poire thought he knew the answer. *The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.*

But as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.

A shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. *Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?*

“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.

“Do you hear anything?”

Muqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.

“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”

Copper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.

*Is that gas? In open containers?* No wonder it was so hard to think down here. *Do they know how dangerous that is?*

“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”

Poire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”

He heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.

“How—how did you—”

And then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”

Around the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.

Muqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “*By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.*”

Poire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”

“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”

Brother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.

Poire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.

Muqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.

“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”

A gunshot.

Muqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*

“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”

“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”

Poire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. *How is there already so much of it?* It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.

“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.

A faint whisper. “Look.”

One feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. *Why is the stupid fool smiling?*

“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”

The priest’s eyes closed.

Unlike the door, they would never open again.

Tears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.

“Grab him.”

The soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of *him*.

“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”

Poire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.

One of the cyrans was screaming.

Poire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.

The door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.

Wrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.

A machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”

“So you’re just going to leave, then?” Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”

Avians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.

Poire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.

“It’s a control panel.”

“Hmm?” Muqwa said.

But how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.

Maybe it still has power, Poire thought.

“It looks like it needs maintenance.”

“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”

“Since when do control panels give instructions?”

“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”

“You think?”

“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed yet. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”

“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.

“Yes?”

He hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”

“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.

Poire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?

What can you possibly see in me?

Beyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.

Judging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.

“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.

“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”

Muqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.

“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.

This time, Poire thought he knew the answer. The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.

But as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.

A shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?

“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.

“Do you hear anything?”

Muqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.

“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”

Copper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.

Is that gas? In open containers? No wonder it was so hard to think down here. Do they know how dangerous that is?

“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”

Poire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”

He heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.

“How—how did you—”

And then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”

Around the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.

Muqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.”

Poire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”

“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”

Brother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.

Poire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.

Muqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.

“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”

A gunshot.

Muqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*

“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”

“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”

Poire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. How is there already so much of it? It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.

“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.

A faint whisper. “Look.”

One feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. Why is the stupid fool smiling?

“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”

The priest’s eyes closed.

Unlike the door, they would never open again.

Tears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.

“Grab him.”

The soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of him.

“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”

Poire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.

One of the cyrans was screaming.

Poire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.

The door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.

Wrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.

A machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”
