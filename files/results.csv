At least 167 people died in landslides and floods after Tropical Storm Megi devastated the Philippines last Sunday.

A further 110 people are missing and 1.9 million have been adversely affected, the national disaster agency says.

Villages around Baybay city in the central Leyte province were badly hit, with hillside avalanches and overflowing rivers.

In one village, Pilar, about 80% of the houses were washed out to sea.

The agency also reported deaths in the southern Davao region, Mindanao and in the central Negros Orientals province.

Many people fled their homes to shelters or higher ground when the storm, known locally as Agaton, hit the archipelago with winds of up to 65km/h (40mph).

Pictures posted by the Philippines Coast Guard show rescuers carrying the injured on stretchers through chest-high water and ferrying survivors on rafts down flooded streets.

The rescue effort was hampered by rain although conditions eased on Tuesday.

It was the first such storm of the year – the Philippines typically sees an average of 20 each year.

It comes about four months after Super Typhoon Rai devastated many of the nation’s south-east islands in December – killing at least 375 people and affecting about 500,000 people.

It was the worst storm to hit the Philippines that year and experts said it had grown stronger far quicker than anticipated.

Marissa Miguel Cano, a public information officer in Baybay, told AFP news agency: “It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that.”

Manila: The death toll from the landslides and flooding spawned by tropical storm Megi has risen to 167, with 110 still missing, the government said on Saturday (April 16, 2022).

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported that 164 died in the central Philippines and three in the southern Philippines. The agency, which culls reports from the provinces affected by disasters, added that there are 110 more missing in the central Philippines.

Megi dumped rains in the central and southern Philippine regions before and after it hit land on April 10, inundating many areas and setting off landslides in several villages in Baybay City and Abuyog town in Leyte province.

On Friday, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited the devastated province and handed relief goods to the survivors. He conducted an aerial inspection of the villages buried by mudslides.

The central Philippines is in the typhoon alley and usually the gateway of typhoons to the country. Landslides and flash floods are common across the Philippines during the rainy season, especially when typhoons hit.

The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, mainly due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire and Pacific typhoon belt. On average, this archipelagic country experiences 20 typhoons every year, some of which are intense and destructive.

Megi is the first storm to batter the Southeast Asian country this year.

TACLOBAN CITY – What was supposed to be Remigio Mejia’s cheerful celebration of his 50th birthday on Friday (April 15) ended up in mournful vigil for his daughter and granddaughter who died in landslide that swamped villages here during the Tropical Depression Agaton’s onslaught a few days back.

“I gathered my children in our house in Brgy. Maypatag (Ambuhan) from our other house in the barrio in preparation for my birthday. I was supposed to slaughter a pig for the celebration. We were happy before this happened,” recalled Mejia.

He said they were awakened by a loud rumbling noise around 3 a.m. on Monday (April 11) in what turned out to be an experience so tragic and so painful.

“When my wife and son got up, we were blown away by the mud coming from the mountain,” he recalled.

One of his sons was saved when he covered himself under their refrigerator that leaned to the wall.

“I heard my children crying for help. I told my son to call for help while I dug through the mud to save them,” he narrated.

He said that because of the landslide, it took time before the villagers came to help him rescue his children.

“At first I could hear one of them calling for help (Tabang) for about 20 minutes. I tried digging with my bare hands with no light until her voice stopped, then another one cried for help,” he narrated.

Remigio was able to save one of them. However, his 16-year-old daughter and 8-year-old granddaughter were already dead when they found them. That broke his heart.

He said the village chief of Brgy. Imelda was kind enough to allow them to have the vigil in the Brgy. Hall, and let them sleep there together with the families of the other victims.

Meanwhile, Mantesa Polvera and her sister Karen Joy, who both came home from Luzon could also not believe that their whole family was buried alive in the landslide in Brgy. Mailhi.

While they were attending the wake of their mother, three siblings, and two nieces, they found out that their father’s body has been recovered from the rubble.

Their uncle and one other relative remain missing.

Aside from grieving the loss of their loved ones, Mantesa and her siblings are having trouble finding the money for the burial of their family members who perished.

They were grateful for Bernandino Tacoy of BGT Cares Foundation who arrived from a relief operation to the evacuees and extended burial assistance to them.

“This is a huge help for us. We will just go back to Manila because we no longer have a family and home to go to. We will just continue with our lives and offer it all to God even if this is really hard for us,” she lamented.",Families mourn loss of loved ones in Leyte landslides,[],2022-04-15 00:00:00,,"TACLOBAN CITY – What was supposed to be Remigio Mejia’s cheerful celebration of his 50th birthday on Friday (April 15) ended up in mournful vigil for his daughter and granddaughter who died in landslide that swamped villages here during the Tropical Depression Agaton’s onslaught a few days back.

Manila: The death toll from tropical storm Megi that battered the Philippines rose to 138, said the authorities.

Central and southern parts of the Philippines were hit by flooding and massive landslides last Saturday and Sunday, with the central Leyte province being the worst affected with 132 deaths.

The Baybay City government on Thursday said in a report that 101 bodies have been retrieved so far from the landslides in several villages in the city. Police said 31 bodies were recovered in Abuyog town in Leyte province, one in Samar province and two in Cebu province.

The Philippine military said 159 areas in the provinces of Capiz, Aklan, Antique, and Iloilo in central Philippines were inundated as of Wednesday even as Megi dissipated, Xinhua news agency reported.

Megi, which hit land last Sunday, is the first tropical storm this year to hit the Southeast Asian country. The Philippines archipelago which lies on the Pacific typhoon belt is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms every year as one of the world`s most disaster-prone countries.

The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by tropical storm Megi rose to 148 on Thursday, official figures showed, as more bodies were found in mud-caked villages.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centres.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Megi — devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog municipality have retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 42 people died in landslides that hit three villages in the municipality, police said. Another person drowned.

Most of those deaths were in Pilar, with at least 28 bodies brought by boat to a sandy lot near the municipal government building after roads leading to the settlement were cut off by landslides.

More than 100 remained missing, and Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP there was little hope of finding anyone else alive.

An aerial photo showed a wide stretch of mud and earth that had swept down a mountain to the sea, crushing everything in its path.

The wreckage of houses and debris was scattered along the shore.

Bad weather and thick mud had complicated retrieval efforts in Pilar, where the ground was unstable. Searchers were also combing the coastline after some bodies were swept kilometres away by ocean currents.

“This will not end soon, it could go on for days,” Traya warned.

Many of those who died had hiked to higher ground to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councillor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto, her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

– Scores missing in Baybay –

Another 101 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City at the weekend, local authorities said. At least 103 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos, where 42 people died and 93 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when sodden soil shot down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud, which has started to smell of rotting flesh.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, and one person died in the central province of Iloilo, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

Megi struck at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most important holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, when thousands travel to visit relatives.

It came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Philippines — ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change — is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

The disaster-prone Southeast Asian nation also lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where many of the world’s volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.","Death toll from Philippine landslides, floods rises to 43",[],2022-04-12 15:25:52+00:00,,"In this handout photo provided by the Philippine Coast Guard, residents are evacuated by rescuers in a flooded village in Panitan, Panay island, Philippines on Tuesday April 12, 2022.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

The disaster-prone Southeast Asian nation also lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where many of the world’s volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.","in this handout photo provided by the philippine coast guard, residents are evacuated by rescuers in a flooded village in panitan, panay island, philippines on tuesday april 12, 2022. heavy rains caused by a summer tropical depression killed at least several people in the central and southern philippines, mostly due to landslides, officials said monday.

Philippine authorities on Wednesday struggled to distribute aid to tens of thousands of displaced people sheltering in evacuation centres after typhoon Megi triggered landslides in coastal provinces that left 56 dead and dozens missing.

More than 42,000 people were displaced and 200 injured when Megi made landfall at the weekend, the first tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines this year. The storm has now dissipated, the state weather bureau said.

Search-and-rescue efforts were focused in Baybay city, a mountainous area prone to landslides in the eastern Philippines, which has seen the majority of casualties so far, data from police and disaster agencies showed. Images on social media showed bodies, including those of children, being pulled from under thick mud during rescue operations.

Meanwhile, survivors were still being evacuated from flooded areas, coastguard spokesperson, Commodore Armand Balilo, told a public briefing on Wednesday.

""Water systems here have been bogged down so our problem is drinking water,"" Norberto Oja, a health officer in Baybay, told DZRH radio station. The city has also sought help from nearby areas to boost its healthcare capacity, he added.

Baybay mayor Jose Carlos Cari told DZMM radio station, ""There's aid like food and medicines but the problem is management in evacuation centres.""

A foundation of broadcasting firm ABS-CBN said it was waiting for floods to subside before distributing 7,500 food packs.

Port operations in several provinces had resumed but scattered rain showers were expected over the eastern coasts facing the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean.

Mark Timbal, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told DZRH radio station rescuers had to be cautious because it was still raining in some areas and the risk of landslides was still high.

“The landslides reached far beyond the hazard area, up to relatively safer areas of the community,” he said.

Many of the dead were caught in landslides triggered by torrential rain from Tropical Storm Megi.

The death toll from landslides and floods in the Philippines has risen to 67 with scores missing and feared dead, officials said, as rescuers dug up more bodies with bare hands and backhoes in crushed villages.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte.

Thirteen people died and around 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality, after a torrent of mud and earth pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Traya told AFP, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said.

A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar.

She said she tried to outrun it, but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto told AFP by telephone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

Disaster-prone Philippines is regularly ravaged by storms – including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 – with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Baybay City is also reeling after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements over the weekend, killing at least 48 people and injuring over 100, local authorities said. Twenty-seven are still missing, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

‘Many of us died’

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

The death toll from Megi is expected to rise as rescue operations switch to recovering bodies.

Abuyog police chief Captain James Mark Ruiz said more boats were needed for victims in Pilar. But getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiber glass boats and there are steel bars exposed in the sea so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing too”.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

It came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

The death toll from landslides and floods in the Philippines rose to 58 on Wednesday, official tallies showed, as rescuers dug up more bodies with their bare hands in villages crushed by rain-induced avalanches.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi — the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year — were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

At least 47 people died and 27 were missing after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements around Baybay City over the weekend, local authorities said. More than 100 people were injured, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village — part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte — resumed at first light on Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people.

The operation came a day after a landslide pushed many houses in the village into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Ruiz said more boats were needed to rescue victims and retrieve bodies in the ongoing search after landslides cut off road access to the community.

Around 50 survivors have been ferried from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook on Tuesday.

Photos posted by the agency showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

Medical workers rushed to treat victims as they were brought to shore, applying bandages to cuts and providing emergency blankets. One woman had her right arm in a splint.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died and that rescue operations were ongoing.

Port operations suspended

Search operations also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook on Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Megi came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Agaton — the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year — were in the central province of Leyte where a series of landslides has devastated communities.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte where a series of landslides devastated communities.

At least 47 people died and 27 were missing after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements around Baybay City over the weekend, local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village – part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte – resumed at first light Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people a day after a landslide pushed most houses into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Around 50 survivors have been rescued from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook Tuesday.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died.

“I can’t give you exact details... because our operation is ongoing,” he said.

Port operations suspended

Search operations have also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Megi came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines – ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts – is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Search efforts will continue in villages buried beneath mud with dozens of people still missing.

The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by Tropical Storm Megi has risen to at least 115, as search teams found more bodies in mud-buried villages.

Eighty-six of the casualties were in Baybay, a mountainous area prone to landslides in central Leyte province, where 236 people were also injured, the city government said in a report.

Megi was the first tropical storm this year to hit the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands.

Dozens of people are still missing and feared dead after several days of torrential rain with tens of thousands of people forced into evacuation centres.

Emergency teams retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 26 people were killed there and about 150 remain missing, authorities said, with little hope of finding anyone else alive.

Many of those who died had hiked up the mountain to avoid flash floods, villagers told the AFP news agency.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the mud hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

“The search, rescue and retrieval operations will continue,” a Philippine Army infantry unit in Baybay said on Facebook.

Aerial photographs and video from the local government showed collapsed slopes, burying coconut plantations and houses in dirt and mud. In one area, rescuers had to use rubber boats to reach a landslide.

Megi made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65 kilometres (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80 kph (49 mph), but has since dissipated.

The Philippines, ranked among the nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

In December, more than 400 people were killed and nearly 1,400 injured after Typhoon Rai tore through the central Philippines. Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, killed 6,300 people in 2013.","Storm Megi: 115 dead in the Philippines due to floods, landslides",[],2022-04-14 00:00:00,,"Search efforts will continue in villages buried beneath mud with dozens of people still missing.

TACLOBAN CITY––The number of persons who died due to landslides in Baybay City and Abuyog town in Leyte reached 96 on Thursday, April 14.

Records of the Baybay City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office show that rescuers pulled out 64 persons from the mud and other debris after the devastation brought by Tropical Depression “Agaton.”

In Abuyog, 32 persons, 29 of whom were residents of Barangay Pilar, had been retrieved.

The number of fatalities in the two landslide-hit areas was expected to increase as retrieval operations continued.

Anamelle Bantaculo, village councilor of Kantagnos, one of the worst-hit areas in Baybay, appealed for help, especially food, water, medicine, blanket, and even tarpaulin for residents, who survived the mudslide but lost their homes.

“Our gymnasium is now occupied by 65 families. I’m asking people to help us even by providing tents for affected families, especially those who lost their homes,” she said.

In Abuyog, about 43 kilometers away from Baybay City, 32 people died due to a landslide.

Fr. Amadeo Alvero of the Palo Archdiocese and part of the Caritas in Palo said he did not expect the tragedy to happen.

“I talked to some survivors who thought they could not survive. Indeed most of them were still shocked. Many of them shared that they made a great run for them to survive. And they prayed hard, calling God to spare their lives,” he said.

“Many are still waiting for the missing members of their families as the rescuers continue to retrieve bodies from the rubbles,” he added.

Residents believed 177 persons were missing from Pilar, a village located at the foot of a mountain where the landslide originated.

On Wednesday, Social Welfare Secretary Rolando Joselito Bautista visited Baybay City and went to the villages of Bunga and Katagnos where he extended financial assistance to affected families.

17,1648836379,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/ttxboo/everyone_should_be_at_least_a_lightprepper/,1,"Hi all, I wrote a little blog where I talk about why everyone should prep at least a little bit. It is mostly aimed at people that not fully understand the concept of prepping or simply do not think about such things. Thought maybe some of you like it.

&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;  
Preppers are known to be some crazy guys that think tomorrow the earth will stop rotating and they will have to survive all on their own. Or they think the state will collapse while a nuclear war is raging, and the neighbours will kill each other for food and water. Most people shake that of as paranoid thinking and leave it with that but there is some important reasoning behind all these preparations for Armageddon.  
&lt;br&gt; 
Hear me out. &lt;br&gt;  


I always wanted to be a prepper, knowing how to survive in the wild and be prepared for whatever the world throws at us. I never took the steps to become one but the situation in Ukraine sparked my motivation. I started to read the suggestions and instruction of my government on how to act and prepare for situation the state ranks as “possible disasters to be prepared”. Read into a few prepper guides and started to put together two lists, one for hunker down supplies and one for bugging out.
&lt;br&gt; 
Most governments suggest that you have food and water for at least two weeks and a battery radio stored somewhere at your home. The reason behind this is that in case of a disaster, what ever it might be, the state will need some time to assess the situation and organize the needed steps. This can take up to two weeks until help arrives at your location. Now it comes to why I think everyone should prep at least a little bit. After my research I found the following situations feasible to happen where you would be on the save side if you have at least the state-suggested supplies: &lt;br&gt;

* Blackout for over a week (Shortage or Cyberattack)
* Complete collapse of communication and power grid (Solar Storm)
* Supply shortage (Global situations)
* Natural disaster (Floods, storms…)
* War
* Nuclear disaster (A long blackout means no cooling, possible meltdown)

&lt;br&gt;  
I ranked them in order on how probable I think they are. In all those cases I do not think that the state will collapse, therefore there is not a real need to be prepared for a year+ stay in your bunker. What could happen is that you get disconnected form important infrastructure (maybe a landslide destroyed a street) or you have to flee in a moments notice (flood or fire). Basically, there are two situations it would make sense to be prepared:  
&lt;br&gt;

- Hunker down for a few days  
- Flee with a short preparation time  
&lt;br&gt;
Those two situations are likely in a sense of statistics and in those cases I think it is feasible to use the saying “Better Save than Sorry”. &lt;br&gt;  


## Two week hunker down

It does not cost an awful amount of money to have supplies for two weeks at home (per person, most forget that!), get a few cans of food, bottled water, a battery radio (the state will broadcast information and instructions) and check once a year if the supplies are still inside their consumption date, DONE!

## Bugging out

At least where I live, there would be a maximum of three days walking until I would be in a save-zone or near a bigger city (you would need to assess your location in that regard), therefore my bugging out bag is made for four days (one extra day, you never know). This investment is a bit more expensive, you need a good backpack, a med kit, good shoes, means to sleep (I chose a hang mate), food that is not too heavy, a compass with a map, a fire kit and so on. You also should invest in building up skills like making a fire, navigating with a compass and map or finding a good place to sleep for the night. Instead of seeing it as an investment that then gets dusty in your cellar you could make a hobby out of it! Plan a route on your map, walk it with a compass and sleep outside for a night (wonderful way of sleeping and the starts will take your breath away) or make a trip with your kids, they will love it. And a nice benefit I have with my bag, anytime some friends come and ask to camp, I do not even have to pack, I just grab my bag and go. 
&lt;br&gt;
To be fair, I already think such a bag is not necessary if your threat model does not see bugging out as an option, maybe you have kids and can’t walk that long. The least thing you have to do in my opinion is to have all your documents (passports, birth certificates…) together, in case of evacuation you can just grab them without thinking and go. Panic can make you forgetful and you do not want to be in a situation where you stand in front of a border without your documents.

The thing with prepping is that it makes fun, yes preparing for a nuclear winter can be fun! Not only will you have adventures while hiking and testing your gear, but you can also use those skills in your normal day to day life. Camping with friends and need a fire? No problem for you. While at work someone got hurt? You can help them with your first aid skills. The list goes on. You do not need to be prepared for a full-on nuclear war or a zombie outbreak, but at least be prepared for what the government needs you to be, they count on you.

Hi all, I wrote a little blog where I talk about why everyone should prep at least a little bit. It is mostly aimed at people that not fully understand the concept of prepping or simply do not think about such things. Thought maybe some of you like it.

Preppers are known to be some crazy guys that think tomorrow the earth will stop rotating and they will have to survive all on their own. Or they think the state will collapse while a nuclear war is raging, and the neighbours will kill each other for food and water. Most people shake that of as paranoid thinking and leave it with that but there is some important reasoning behind all these preparations for Armageddon.

Hear me out.

I always wanted to be a prepper, knowing how to survive in the wild and be prepared for whatever the world throws at us. I never took the steps to become one but the situation in Ukraine sparked my motivation. I started to read the suggestions and instruction of my government on how to act and prepare for situation the state ranks as “possible disasters to be prepared”. Read into a few prepper guides and started to put together two lists, one for hunker down supplies and one for bugging out. Most governments suggest that you have food and water for at least two weeks and a battery radio stored somewhere at your home. The reason behind this is that in case of a disaster, what ever it might be, the state will need some time to assess the situation and organize the needed steps. This can take up to two weeks until help arrives at your location. Now it comes to why I think everyone should prep at least a little bit. After my research I found the following situations feasible to happen where you would be on the save side if you have at least the state-suggested supplies:

Blackout for over a week (Shortage or Cyberattack)

Complete collapse of communication and power grid (Solar Storm)

Supply shortage (Global situations)

Natural disaster (Floods, storms…)

War

Nuclear disaster (A long blackout means no cooling, possible meltdown)

I ranked them in order on how probable I think they are. In all those cases I do not think that the state will collapse, therefore there is not a real need to be prepared for a year+ stay in your bunker. What could happen is that you get disconnected form important infrastructure (maybe a landslide destroyed a street) or you have to flee in a moments notice (flood or fire). Basically, there are two situations it would make sense to be prepared:

Hunker down for a few days

Flee with a short preparation time

Those two situations are likely in a sense of statistics and in those cases I think it is feasible to use the saying “Better Save than Sorry”.

Two week hunker down

It does not cost an awful amount of money to have supplies for two weeks at home (per person, most forget that!), get a few cans of food, bottled water, a battery radio (the state will broadcast information and instructions) and check once a year if the supplies are still inside their consumption date, DONE! With little money and effort, you not just followed what the government asks you to do, you are also ready to wait comfortably at your home until help arrives.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Heavy rains caused by a summer tropical depression killed at least 25 people in the central and southern Philippines, mostly due to landslides, officials said Monday.

Twenty-two villagers died in landslides in four villages in Baybay city in central Leyte province on Sunday and Monday, city police chief Lt. Col. Joemen Collado said. At least six other people were reported missing in the landslides and a search was underway, he said.

Three other storm-related deaths were reported by the government’s main disaster-response agency in the southern provinces of Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental.

“In one village, a landslide occurred and other victims, unfortunately, were also swept away by the surge of water,” Collado told the DZBB radio network. “There were at least six missing but there could be more.”

Nearly 200 floods were reported in different areas in central and southern provinces over the weekend, displacing about 30,000 families, some of which were moved to emergency shelters, officials said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers in flooded communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

Two people have died and two others are fighting for life after a landslide on a walking track in the Blue Mountains, about 100km from Sydney.

Emergency services were called about 1.30pm after reports of the accident involving a group of five walkers on a track near Wentworth Falls.

NSW police acting superintendent John Nelson said a man and a boy died at the scene of the accident. A woman and a boy were in a critical condition, and a girl was walking out from the site with the assistance of authorities, he said.

Nelson described the accident as tragic and said the girl was extremely distressed.

NSW ambulance acting chief superintendent Stewart Clarke said the two critically injured patients had suffered significant head and abdominal injuries. They would be sedated and intubated before being winched to a helicopter and flown to hospital, he said.

The scene that had confronted paramedics was “exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking”, he said, especially as it involved children. The girl had been uninjured but would be assessed again by paramedics and offered pastoral care once she returned to Wentworth Falls.

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” Clarke said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.

“This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

Nelson said the site was incredibly dangerous and unstable after the accident but conditions in general had been favourable for walking on Monday and the track had been open, despite recent flooding in the area.

“Obviously there’s been a major weather event – I can’t comment on the condition of this walking track.”

The family's 50-year-old mother and a second son, who is 14, were treated at the scene by critical care paramedics before being airlifted out of the valley by a rescue helicopter, New South Wales ambulance spokesman Stewart Clarke told reporters.

After being assessed, they would be taken to ""the most appropriate hospital,"" Mr Clarke added, with surgery a possibility.

He called the situation ""heartbreaking"", adding that the patients had ""significant head and abdominal injuries"" and had to be sedated and intubated to help them breathe before being winched to safety.

The five were holidaying in Australia, police said, some of the four million tourists drawn to the Blue Mountains National Park each year.

Weeks of wet weather in Sydney preceded the landslip, leaving the area ""extremely dangerous and unstable"" for rescuers, Mr Clarke said.

Detective Superintendent John Nelson, from the Blue Mountains area command, called it ""a tragic scene"", adding that rescuers were ""working under quite arduous conditions.

""A girl is walking out at the moment, who is obviously clearly [and] extremely distressed,"" he said.

Officers would try to speak to her to find out what happened, he said.

Weather conditions were reasonable, he said, adding that he understood the hiking trail was open at the time.

Emergency services were called to Wentworth Pass around 1.40pm, after being contacted by someone who was ""in or near the group"", Mr Clarke said.

Police helicopters, local officers and a specialist rescue team were deployed to the remote location in dense bushland, about a 90-minute walk from the car park.

The injured pair were winched out about 6pm, Mr Clarke said.

""[It is] exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking, especially when you start involving children,"" he said.

A British father and son have been killed in a landslide in Australia, with two other family members left fighting for their lives.

The tragic incident took place in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, with a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy declared dead at the scene.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched from the location in critical condition, according to New South Wales Police.

The last member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was walked back by emergency services - an hour-and-a-half trek from the scene - and has been taken to a children’s hospital. The young girl, who escaped the landslide, reportedly raised the alarm in call to the emergency services at around 1:30pm, Mail Online reported.

The distraught teenager allegedly told the operator: “I don’t know where we are.” The family were holidaying in Australia and had gone walking in the mountains.

The 15-year-old girl was “extremely distressed” following the incident, the authorities said. “We’ve focused on caring for her while the best medical care is given to her mum and brother and just trying to get that support for the 15-year-old,” said Supt John Nelson from New South Wales Police.

At around 1.40pm local time on Monday, emergency services were called to Wentworth Pass, Wentworth Falls, after “reports of a concern for welfare for five bushwalkers”, police said in a statement.

The bodies of the British father and his 9-year-old son have now been recovered, police confirmed on Tuesday.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he will be investigating whether the walking track should have been open at the time.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Corportation: “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will.

“Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

Police said on Monday: “Despite efforts by emergency services, two people – a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy – died at the scene.

“Just before 6pm, a 50-year-old woman and second boy – aged 14 – were winched from the location and taken to Westmead Hospital and the children’s hospital at Westmead, both in critical conditions.”

Det Supt John Nelson, from the Blue Mountains area command, told reporters: “It’s quite a tragic scene. We do have a girl who is walking out at the moment and is clearly extremely distressed.”

NSW Ambulance Acting Ch Supt Stewart Clarke said that the area the family had been walking in was extremely dangerous and unstable.

He added: “This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” he said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.”

Paramedics reportedly said that the injured hikers had suffered head and abdominal injuries.

A British Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia.

We are in contact with the local authorities.”","British father and son, 9, killed in Australian landslide as mother and second child fight for life",[],2022-04-05 08:36:31+00:00,,"A British father and son have been killed in a landslide in Australia, with two other family members left fighting for their lives.

Torrential downpours and flooding have triggered mudslides, killing at least 45 people in South Africa.

Water poured through the city of Durban and surrounding areas in KwaZulu-Natal province on Tuesday. Local officials expect the death toll to rise after a number of people were swept away.

Several hundred people have lost their homes and belongings, and electricity has been cut off to a number of areas.

The city’s port, the largest and busiest in sub-Saharan Africa, and major highways suffered major damage due to sustained rainfall which burst banks of rivers and led to surging waters. Dozens of shipping containers were pictured in the floodwaters, buckled and cracked open.

Transnet, which runs the Durban port, said in a statement that operations had been suspended due to the extreme downpours and high winds.

South Africa’s military has been deployed to Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area on Tuesday to help with rescue efforts locally.

More heavy rain was forecast in the coastal city through this evening.

Recent extreme rainfall in southeast Africa has become more intense and damaging due to the climate crisis, a team of international scientists reported earlier this week.

The World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said that climate change made destructive downpours more likely during back-to-back storms in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in early 2022.

Between January and March, southeast Africa was hit by three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms in just six weeks – with more than a million people affected by extreme rainfall and severe flooding, and some 230 recorded deaths.

“Again we are seeing how the people with the least responsibility for climate change are bearing the brunt of the impacts,” said Dr Friederike Otto, who is part of the WWA which analyses the links beween climate change and extreme weather events.

*You’re not supposed to travel these roads at night.*

*They say it’s because they’re too narrow, and too wild, that it’d be easy to pop a tire. That these roads are so isolated, that it’d take hours for anyone to find you. “Travel during the day,” they say. “Stick to the paved roads around these wild woods and whatever you do, avoid any shortcuts that cut straight through.”*

*“Heed this warning and heed this rhyme; especially, if you were to find yourself at the Sweet Hollow Pass.”*

*Look, I was tired.  I hadn’t eaten in almost twenty-four hours. Arjun had fallen asleep hours ago, after valiantly trying to fight the medication the hospital had injected him with. I didn’t even have him to distract me as my eyelids were growing heavier by the second.*

*I was desperate, and the Sweet Hollow Pass was a shortcut that cut through the tail end of the Six Rivers National Forest. Instead of taking Highway 93 all the way around; the Pass cut straight through, shaving almost three hours off the trip.*

*I could feel my eyelids drooping heavier by the second, so I needed to do something. Anything. Swallowing hard, I took the hard right off Highway 93 and onto Sweet Hollow Pass.*

*\*\**

*They say somebody died out here. Another tourist told me that, during the summer after our freshman year. Jack, Louise, and I had been working in gift shops around Six Rivers when we first heard about it.*

*Almost ten years ago a woman, around thirty years old and traveling by herself, tried to take the shortcut through Sweet Hollow Pass. It had been a particularly rainy summer after a very hard, and dry winter and too much rain in too short of time had led to horrific and cataclysmic mudslides. Apparently she’d been caught in a freak one, according to the police. After another six hours of searching, they managed to find her car… but they never found her.*

*And they never did find the body.*

*They say that on misty, foggy nights, like the night that she disappeared, if you’re traveling on Sweet Hollow Pass, that Sallie Gray will try to find you instead.*

*\*\**

*“Don’t think about that.” I muttered to myself. “Don’t fucking think about that.” I checked the GPS; it was a miracle I still had service out here. 15 MILES, it blinked in fluorescent blue light. “Twenty minutes,” I whispered.*

*It was so dark outside. Trees pressed close, the canopy blocking any hint of moonlight from above, and the windshield was fogging up. I cursed quietly, it was impossible to see outside. I curled my sweatshirt over my fist and reached up, using it to wipe away the condensation. Suddenly, I could see through a tiny sliver.*

*“SHIT.” I cried and turned the steering wheel hard. Heart pounding, I felt the passenger tires skim the edge of an enormous pothole. The car dipped hard, the back tires spinning out but carefully, I felt us move past. Chest tight, I let out a sigh of relief.*

*But it didn’t last long.*

*“FUCK,” I yelled as I hit the brakes again. The car swerved, rear tires spinning again in the mud, but I brought us to a complete stop. Breathing hard, I glanced over at Arjun; he was still out cold. Panic setting in, and the edges of my vision threatening to go white, I peered through that tiny sliver in my windshield.*

*The air left my lungs. “Arjun,” I whispered, reaching over. I shook him, my eyes still staring straight ahead. “Arjun, wake UP.” Nothing, he was out cold. My mouth went dry.*

*There was a girl standing in the road.*

*She was streaked with mud from head-to-toe, like she’d crawled from a shallow grave. Her chin was tucked into her chest, and all I could see was a head of thick, curly brown hair. She was swaying uneasily in the car’s headlights, like she was drugged. I squinted. It looked like she was wearing… something black around her wrists. Bracelets? Rope? Broken handcuffs, maybe? I really couldn’t see through the fogged-up windshield.*

*Slowly, carefully I rolled the window down. “Miss?” I called out quietly. “Are you lost?” My voice fell flat against the silent forest. I hadn’t realized how quiet it had gotten.*

*The girl visibly started at the sound of my voice. Her body twisted, like she didn’t have any control over it. One green eye peeked at me from underneath the mop of curly, brown hair. Then another. She was grinning. Horrifically. Her mouth was stretched horribly, the lips literally going from ear to ear. Yellowed, rotten teeth peeked through. That’s when I realized something.*

*I felt all the air leave my lungs. “Holy shit.” I cried, not caring if I finally woke Arjun up. “I can’t believe it.”*

*“She looks… like me.”*

\*\*

“Aimee. AIMEE.”

“Huh?” I suddenly snapped back to Arjun hitting my shoulder. Hard. “Wh… what’s going on?”

“You tell me.” Arjun said, uneasily. He was sitting leaning over me, and had my shoulder in a death grip. “You were zoned out and staring straight ahead. I just woke up to find us sitting in the middle of freakin’ Sweet Hollow Pass.”

*The girl in the road.* I whipped around, my heart beating furiously and my eyes searching desperately. There was no sign of her. I could feel the engine humming underneath my shaking hands. “The girl! Did you see her?”

“See who?” Arjun said quietly, his eyes never leaving me. “The girl! She looked like-” I whipped around again, searching valiantly around the car. Nothing. No trace of her. “-Looked like me.”

“She looked like…. you?” Arjun said cautiously. “Aimee…” He said quietly. “Are you seeing things?” I swallowed uneasily. Had I fallen asleep without realizing it? While driving? *But it felt so real.*

Cautiously, I settled back into my seat. Heart pounding, I tried to put a lid on the wild panic I felt in my chest. Carefully keeping my expression neutral, I put the car back into drive. “You’re right.” I said quietly. “It was probably nothing.”

\*\*

It wasn’t until we left the forest and the tires finally hit asphalt did I finally take a breath. We were almost there. Jack’s cabin sat almost directly in the center between the town of Willow Creek and the Hoopa Indian Reservation, and alongside the very edge of the Six Rivers National Forest.

We were heading to the small town of Burnt Towers. Burnt Towers was a tiny, unincorporated town of only 300 individuals. However, the proximity to Six Rivers; and the breathtaking; rolling hills of green in the summer, and the changing leaves in the fall, made it an extremely popular tourist spot.

Legend has it that Burnt Towers got its name from a pair of enormous structures that suddenly appeared at the entrance of the town almost two hundred years ago. Seemingly overnight, these forty-feet tall monstrosities were erected without nary a clue as to who actually built them.

And there they stood, until one night, at 3 o’clock in the morning, the locals woke up to them entirely engulfed in flames. The fire was massive, hot, and raging out of control. There was nothing anybody could do. The fire service from the nearby town of Cedar Flats had been called but by the time they’d gotten here, it was too late. The towers had completely burnt down.

Hence, the name. Burnt Towers.

Burnt Towers had one main road in town. There was a gas station, a bank, a grocery store, a hardware store, several stores filled with outdoor and hiking-type gear, and several restaurants. There were a few speakeasies and dive bars too, but they were located a little further down. There were five main offshoots from the downtown area; mainly neighborhoods, which is where all the locals lived, and hotels. The park that we used to play at was back here too.

Jack’s cabin was located off one of those main offshoots. It was located a few miles outside town, at the very top of a large hill. It was just as beautiful as I remembered; a large, white Victorian-style cabin with flowers climbing the large columns that stood on either side of the front door. The flowers climbed the side of the house, and spilled out onto the large, wrap-around porch.

This place had been built with love. Jack’s dad had built it for Jack’s mom, after she’d been diagnosed with a rare kidney disorder almost thirty years ago. “A good luck charm,” he called it. It must’ve worked, because after moving to Grovefield, Jack’s mom had managed to outlast the diagnosis for almost *thirty* years. “A living medical miracle,” they called her, until she passed away almost fourteen years ago.

\*\*

I turned my phone over, the white light brightening the dim back patio. The screen clicked on. Nothing. “Of course,” I muttered, as my heart sank.

Jack hadn’t texted me. I shouldn’t be surprised. Despite what he’d said to me, almost ten hours ago in the parking lot of the Tuolumne Hospital, I doubt he was actually still considering meeting us. There was too much going on for him to just drop everything. He had work, he had school, he had his girlfriend.. I shook my head.

But I couldn’t help but feel the echoes of his words. I could see him in my mind’s eye, and my cheek still burned from where he’d touched it. *Of course, I’m meeting you, Aimee.* He’d said to me in that parking lot. He’d *promised* me. *Somebody has to finish fixing you up.*

I shook my head again, hard. *Fuck*, I couldn’t afford to think like that now and I took a sip of tea to clear my head. It clicked gently on the patio table, next to the binders from Arjun’s basement.

They were the ones I’d snatched, desperately, before we were forced to make a break for it. They were filled with maps, missing persons reports dating back almost sixty years ago, and pages and pages of tightly-packed, handwritten notes. I didn’t understand it and frankly, it was making my head hurt. I shook my head again. I needed Arjun to wake up and explain.

With a sigh, I sat back in my seat, thinking about everything that’d transpired in the last two days. “Three weeks.” I murmured quietly to myself. “What’s happening in three weeks?” Monroe was sitting outside with me, and she was tilting her head back and forth, as if she was listening. I looked down at her. “I don’t suppose you know what Louise’s dad meant when he said, ‘it’s happening in three weeks?’”

Monroe cocked her head and let out a low woof. I laughed.

“I don’t know either, girl.” I rubbed my temples hard, feeling the bones of my knuckles grind against my skull. “Of course, except for one thing.” Monroe was still watching me, her eyes intently focused on mine. “The anniversary of Paula’s disappearance.” I sighed again. “And at the rate everything’s going, I’m sure something fucking horrible is going to happen.”

I reached over for the teacup, accidentally swatting a firefly that’d landed on it. “Oh, I’m sorry little guy.” I whispered as I pulled my hand away. It flew away, dipping and weaving, like a drunk man leaving a bar. I looked up. The whole backyard was filled with them.

The fireflies looked like flickering stars, coming down for a brief visit. It was… beautiful. With how they clustered around the tops of trees and in the bushes and grass, it looked like the entire backyard was on fire. *Ugh*. I rubbed my temples again. My head was *killing* me.

This headache had started not long after the little… drive through Sweet Hollow Pass. I used to get these horrible, mind-splitting headaches as a kid. The kind where it felt like something fat and horrible had taken a shit on your brain, and had also left behind something that was now slowly hatching inside your skull. For months, my mom had been convinced it was just migraines. “Migraines?” Doctors questioned, perplexed; when my dad *finally* took me in. “But… what four year-old gets migraines?”

Of course, it probably didn’t help that I was introduced to Xanax not long after this.

I dug my fingernails into my thigh, forcing the fog to part and my head to clear. *Look*. I thought to myself. *It’s been almost six years since I’d gotten one.This is probably just… stress-related.* I tilted the teacup back, chugging the rest of it. I’d go buy some Advil in the morning.

“Come on Monroe.” I tapped my thigh, motioning to her, and headed inside, locking the patio door behind me.

\*\*

By the time I woke up, my headache had gotten *worse*. Instead of just the throbbing headache from last night; it now felt like my brain was trying to dismember itself piece by piece, and squeeze the brain tissue through both ear canals.

I sat up, clutching my head. “Fuckkk.” I moaned. My feet touched the bare hardwood floors, and I shivered. It was freezing. I heaved myself up and stumbled around, searching in vain for the keys. In my haste, I accidentally smacked into Mornoe, who was laying at the foot of the bed.

She let out a loud woof, throwing me an incredibly judgemental look. I laughed. It was the same look she used to give me when in high-school I’d sneak in through the oversize doggy-door to sleep at Arjun’s, because I was high as a kite and avoiding my dad. But I knew what would change her mind.

“Wanna go for a ride?”

\*\*

The bell dinged as I walked into Ms. Kees General Store. Burnt Towers was empty this morning;  as apparently 7 in the morning was still a little early for people, I guess.

The scent of pine needles, deck stain, and leather oil pulled me in like a hug, and I took a deep sniff. I let it out. *Ahhhhh*. Everything was exactly the same. The lines of fishing poles stacked against the far wall. The cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling and filled with packets of ramen, cereal and the protein bars that always crumbled into dust everytime you bit into them. This is where we used to get our gear for the long camping trips that were the hallmark of our summers in Burnt Towers. I bet if I looked, I could find the old aluminum flask that Jack and I had hidden inside one of the popcorn ceiling tiles when I worked here during the summer before our sophomore year.

That flask of Jameson kept me blessedly numb from the chaos that always came with the crazy summer tourist months.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.* Suddenly, I heard the familiar sound of spurs on a hardwood floor. “Is that… Ms. Aimee I see lurking around my store again?”

I felt myself light up into a smile. “Ms. Kees!” I cried. She was in the back of the store, smoking a cigarette behind the cash registers. A Marlboro Light: I’d recognize that plume of smoke anywhere. She used to go through a pack a day. “Despite all efforts from local authorities, you just couldn’t keep me away,” I laughed.

She tapped the cigarette in her trademark ceramic cowboy hat ashtray, ashing it. “Mhmmm.” She grumbled. “I can remember a time or two when the cops came calling to my door.” She cracked a grin. “And you ain’t even my baby!”

“What’ll it be today, sweetheart?” She slapped both hands on the thick, carved desk. “Look.” She eagerly pointed. “We’ve got some new items I think you’d be interested in.” She held up a silver-and-red, latest edition S14 German Swiss Army Knife. “Brand new, and fresh off the boat..”

“No, no.” I begged her off, holding up my hands. “Not today. Just these.” On the counter I had set a jumbo-size bottle of Advil and a bag of Purina dog food.

“Advil, huh?” She rested one sharp eye on me. “You’re getting headaches again?” Her brow furrowed as her dark gray eyebrows pulled together. She looked… concerned. Her gray hair, which I could remember used to be the same shade as her smokey, dark brown eyes, was pulled back into a severe bun. Her tanned, olive skin contrasted sharply against the thick, white cable knit sweater she had on. “I thought those had gone away?”

“Mhmmm.” I winced again. The headache was beginning to pick up speed, like a storm gathering in the horizon. I cracked open the bottle and quickly downed a couple, hoping that this would stave it off. But as the pills slid down my throat, I suddenly felt a strong wave of dizziness. “Whew.” I swallowed hard, as everything threatened to come back up. “I’m sorry, is there somewhere I can sit down?”

“Uh, sure hun.” Ms. Kees’s spurs clinked as she pulled me around and into the back office. I felt her hands on my shoulders as she half-pushed, and I half-fell, into an uncomfortable, straight-backed chair. I tried to swallow, wincing painfully as my throat felt dry and scratchy. Ms. Kees noticed.

“Sit tight,” She cried. “Let me get you some water too.”

*Fuckkk, my head was throbbing.* Pressing the palms of my hands against my temples, I sighed and looked around. Literally nothing had changed since the last time I was here.

A large shelving unit, filling almost the entire back wall, was filled with cardboard boxes of inventory. Fishing gear, clothing items, hats, etc. Next to the shelving unit, was a small propped-up card table that we considered our “breakroom.” Considering that it was just a mini-fridge and a microwave on a fold-out table, Jack always used to joke that “we were one smelly fish sandwich away from total disaster.”

But, wait. I paused. *This was new.* I got up and walked over for a better look. I felt dizzy, as all the blood rushed to my head.

*HAVE YOU SEEN ME?* screamed down at me from a hundred different posters. MISSING. Hundreds of faces jumped out at me. Men, women, children: it looked like every age and race was up on that board. Ms. Kees had hung a giant, orange cork board that was *filled* with missing posters.

Stunned, and momentarily forgetting the roaring headache, I reached up to trace the face of a missing child. “Betty Ingram,” I read, my voice catching my throat. “Ten years old, missing in Yosemite National Park.” I read another one. “Patricia Rose, aged 45 years old. Last seen in Six Rivers National Park.” My voice cracked. “Tom Parker. Twenty-one years old. Reported missing after friends woke up to find him gone from their campsite in Tahoe National Forest.”

I checked the dates. A shiver ran through me. These were all dated from the past ten years. “Beatrice Montclair, aged 31. Reported missing after she didn’t return from a hike in…” I paused. “In Yosemite National Park, on the Glacier Point Trail.” I felt my brain churning. I stared at her photo.

“What happened to you?” I whispered. Her dark eyes stared back at me, saying nothing. The longer I stared at her, the worse my headache was getting. I felt tears rise in the back of my throat; as I suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to cry. Her picture blurred, as they clouded my vision. *What the fuck was happening out in Yosemite National Park?*

*Fuck*. I cupped my ears. The pressure in my head had gotten so bad, that my ears were starting to ring. It sounded shrill, high-pitched, and like tuning into a TV channel where someone was being brutally murdered. I grimaced, glancing back at Beatrice’s picture. *Is this what you sounded like right before you disappeared?*

Then as if in response to my question, her picture suddenly *moved*.

\*\*

I gasped. “No. No. Nonononono.” I muttered frantically, screwing my eyes shut. My brain felt like it was on fire, the pressure in my ears was becoming unbearable and most of all, I just couldn’t believe *that this was happening again.*

It's been years since… *Shit, no*. *Stop*. I wouldn’t let myself think about it. I backed away from the wall, feeling behind me for the chair. My knee hit the corner of the filing cabinet hard, but I didn’t *dare* open my eyes. My heart was pounding furiously, *where was my bag?*

“Aimee?”

My eyes flew open. Ms. Kees was standing in the doorway. “Is everything alright?” She asked, looking uneasy. I must’ve looked silly, walking backwards with my eyes shut like that. She had a bottle of water in one hand, and a hot water bottle in the other.

“I’m fine!” I chirped, forcing a smile on my face. “Sorry about that, I’m feeling *a lot* better.” I headed out towards the front door, my heart pounding. “I’ll call you once I’m settled in!” I could hear her calling out to me as I stumbled towards the front door, but I couldn’t stop. I could feel Beatrice’s eyes watching me as I walked out.

\*\*

In a daze, I burst onto a busy sidewalk. Burnt Towers was bustling now. The shops were open, the diner I’d parked in-front of was packed and people were racing around, getting ready to hit the trails early.

In the morning light, flush against the normalcy of people going to breakfast with their families, the Pontiac looked *bad*. I winced, seeing heads turn as I opened the driver’s side door and I knew they were looking at the busted passenger window and the twisted chunks of metal and glass. I knew I should care, but I didn’t.

I couldn’t care. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t *breathe*. My stomach roiled and flipped, as a kaleidoscope of emotion cycled through my brain. The headache had gotten worse, those two Advil I’d taken in Ms. Kees’s shop be damned, and the pain ebbed and flowed with the pulse of my blood. I fought back tears as I couldn’t believe *this was happening again.*

“No.” I whispered. “Stop. Don’t cry.” I shut my eyes tightly and gripped the steering wheel. “You’re gonna make it worse.” I could feel my knuckles starting to turn white. It didn’t help that I everytime I closed my eyes, everytime I *blinked*, I could see Beatrice’s face. I could still see what it looked like the *second it started to move.*

“FUCK. Stop.”

“STOP. Okay *stop*.” I reached over to grab Monroe. “Dude, girl stop barking.” Monroe was sitting in the passenger seat and she was absolutely *losing her mind.* “GIRL this isn’t helping.” People were sitting next to us at the patio tables of Lucky Dave’s Local Spot, and I could feel the heat of the stares from the entire restaurant. I grabbed her collar in an attempt to calm her down.

“Girl, what the fuck are you even barking at-”

My voice trailed off. My blood went cold. I saw where she was looking.

There was something standing behind the dumpsters at the end of the street. I leaned forward, my eyes straining. For a minute, there was nothing. Just a quiet alleyway, behind the local drugstore. *There*. Slowly, as I watched, *something* peeked over the lid of the dumpsters. Then suddenly, it ducked back down.

*Like it was trying to hide.*

Monroe started growling again. The back of my neck started tingling. A cold sweat suddenly broke out, and I felt the ground suddenly drop out from underneath me. *I’d recognize that hair anywhere.*

*This was the same thing I’d seen back in Sweet Hollow Pass. The thing that looked like me.* I smashed my eyes shut, grinding the heel of my hands into my eyes. *Fuck*, the building pressure in my head threatened to pop my eyes like grapes. “Please be gone, please be gone. Please be gone.” I sobbed.

Then I stopped. Breathing in a shuddering, steeling sense of resolve, I gingerly opened them back up. *Nothing.*

My mind felt splintered, chaotic; and like all the pieces were slowly falling apart. I felt trapped, cornered. Like how a field mouse must feel when being stalked by a hawk. I took another big, shuddering breath in.  I looked over at Monroe; she was looking at me, with all the fur standing up on her back. Reaching out, I put my hand on her soft, jet-black head, she was shaking. “Let’s get out of here,” I whispered.

\*\*

The drive home felt agonizingly long. It didn’t help that my head was pounding, and my phone was practically ringing *nonstop*. Whoever this was, they’d called me like *ten times* in the past five minutes. Without looking, I turned off the ringer and tossed it into the footwell of the passenger seat.

It wasn’t five minutes later, when I finally pulled into the winding driveway that led past a pair of massive Douglas Firs and up to Jack’s cabin. To my surprise, Arjun was waiting for me outside. He barely waited for me to park before he threw open my door.

“Aimee, I’ve been calling you.” He said, with one balled-up fist on his hip. “Literally like twenty times. You can’t just not pick up. There’s something we need-.”

“Oh, that was you.” I mumbled, shoving him aside. The bag from Ms. Kees’s swung wide and hit me hard, the Advil digging into my hip bone. “I texted and told you I was going into town.”

“*Yeah*, that was me.” He sounded mad. Arjun tried to follow me, but the bulky cast on his leg slowed him down. “But that’s not what we need to talk about. Aimee listen-”

“Can this wait until after a nap?” I could feel my body shutting down. The events from this morning were catching up to me and I needed at least ten more Advil in me. I walked up to the front door, with Monroe bouncing up the steps next to me. “WAIT, Aimee!” I could hear Arjun crying out right behind me. “WAIT there’s something I need to tell you-”

\*\*

I swung open the front door, to find a mountain of suitcases in the foyer. My heart stopped.

“Oh.” I said quietly.

“-They’re here.” Arjun huffed. He’d finally caught up to me. The red bathrobe he was wearing flapped as he heaved himself up the steps. “They got in about an hour ago.” I could feel the wheels turning in my head. “Arjun.” I said slowly. “Who’s *they*?”

Suddenly, I heard a voice that I never thought I’d hear again. A voice that I knew belonged to my best friend in the entire world, until three years ago when she threatened to shoot me if I didn’t leave her house and never come back. And rightfully so.

“Oh *hell no*.” She cried. “You’ve got to be *fucking* kidding me.” I winced. “Hi Louise.”

“What is she doing here.” Louise growled. Every syntax in her voice positively *dripped* with venom. They were all in the living room. Patrice, Mikey, *Jack…*  The old gang was all here. Jack had brought everybody. I was stunned. I watched as she turned to Jack. “*You told me she wasn’t going to be here.*”

I looked at Arjun. His face looked ashen, and his eyes wheeled wildly between me and Louise. I took a deep breath. “I think now is a good time to take a nap.”

You’re not supposed to travel these roads at night.

They say it’s because they’re too narrow, and too wild, that it’d be easy to pop a tire. That these roads are so isolated, that it’d take hours for anyone to find you. “Travel during the day,” they say. “Stick to the paved roads around these wild woods and whatever you do, avoid any shortcuts that cut straight through.”

“Heed this warning and heed this rhyme; especially, if you were to find yourself at the Sweet Hollow Pass.”

Look, I was tired. I hadn’t eaten in almost twenty-four hours. Arjun had fallen asleep hours ago, after valiantly trying to fight the medication the hospital had injected him with. I didn’t even have him to distract me as my eyelids were growing heavier by the second.

I was desperate, and the Sweet Hollow Pass was a shortcut that cut through the tail end of the Six Rivers National Forest. Instead of taking Highway 93 all the way around; the Pass cut straight through, shaving almost three hours off the trip.

I could feel my eyelids drooping heavier by the second, so I needed to do something. Anything. Swallowing hard, I took the hard right off Highway 93 and onto Sweet Hollow Pass.

**

They say somebody died out here. Another tourist told me that, during the summer after our freshman year. Jack, Louise, and I had been working in gift shops around Six Rivers when we first heard about it.

Almost ten years ago a woman, around thirty years old and traveling by herself, tried to take the shortcut through Sweet Hollow Pass. It had been a particularly rainy summer after a very hard, and dry winter and too much rain in too short of time had led to horrific and cataclysmic mudslides. Apparently she’d been caught in a freak one, according to the police. After another six hours of searching, they managed to find her car… but they never found her.

And they never did find the body.

They say that on misty, foggy nights, like the night that she disappeared, if you’re traveling on Sweet Hollow Pass, that Sallie Gray will try to find you instead.

**

“Don’t think about that.” I muttered to myself. “Don’t fucking think about that.” I checked the GPS; it was a miracle I still had service out here. 15 MILES, it blinked in fluorescent blue light. “Twenty minutes,” I whispered.

It was so dark outside. Trees pressed close, the canopy blocking any hint of moonlight from above, and the windshield was fogging up. I cursed quietly, it was impossible to see outside. I curled my sweatshirt over my fist and reached up, using it to wipe away the condensation. Suddenly, I could see through a tiny sliver.

“SHIT.” I cried and turned the steering wheel hard. Heart pounding, I felt the passenger tires skim the edge of an enormous pothole. The car dipped hard, the back tires spinning out but carefully, I felt us move past. Chest tight, I let out a sigh of relief.

But it didn’t last long.

“FUCK,” I yelled as I hit the brakes again. The car swerved, rear tires spinning again in the mud, but I brought us to a complete stop. Breathing hard, I glanced over at Arjun; he was still out cold. Panic setting in, and the edges of my vision threatening to go white, I peered through that tiny sliver in my windshield.

The air left my lungs. “Arjun,” I whispered, reaching over. I shook him, my eyes still staring straight ahead. “Arjun, wake UP.” Nothing, he was out cold. My mouth went dry.

There was a girl standing in the road.

She was streaked with mud from head-to-toe, like she’d crawled from a shallow grave. Her chin was tucked into her chest, and all I could see was a head of thick, curly brown hair. She was swaying uneasily in the car’s headlights, like she was drugged. I squinted. It looked like she was wearing… something black around her wrists. Bracelets? Rope? Broken handcuffs, maybe? I really couldn’t see through the fogged-up windshield.

Slowly, carefully I rolled the window down. “Miss?” I called out quietly. “Are you lost?” My voice fell flat against the silent forest. I hadn’t realized how quiet it had gotten.

The girl visibly started at the sound of my voice. Her body twisted, like she didn’t have any control over it. One green eye peeked at me from underneath the mop of curly, brown hair. Then another. She was grinning. Horrifically. Her mouth was stretched horribly, the lips literally going from ear to ear. Yellowed, rotten teeth peeked through. That’s when I realized something.

I felt all the air leave my lungs. “Holy shit.” I cried, not caring if I finally woke Arjun up. “I can’t believe it.”

“She looks… like me.”

**

“Aimee. AIMEE.”

“Huh?” I suddenly snapped back to Arjun hitting my shoulder. Hard. “Wh… what’s going on?”

“You tell me.” Arjun said, uneasily. He was sitting leaning over me, and had my shoulder in a death grip. “You were zoned out and staring straight ahead. I just woke up to find us sitting in the middle of freakin’ Sweet Hollow Pass.”

The girl in the road. I whipped around, my heart beating furiously and my eyes searching desperately. There was no sign of her. I could feel the engine humming underneath my shaking hands. “The girl! Did you see her?”

“See who?” Arjun said quietly, his eyes never leaving me. “The girl! She looked like-” I whipped around again, searching valiantly around the car. Nothing. No trace of her. “-Looked like me.”

“She looked like…. you?” Arjun said cautiously. “Aimee…” He said quietly. “Are you seeing things?” I swallowed uneasily. Had I fallen asleep without realizing it? While driving? But it felt so real.

Cautiously, I settled back into my seat. Heart pounding, I tried to put a lid on the wild panic I felt in my chest. Carefully keeping my expression neutral, I put the car back into drive. “You’re right.” I said quietly. “It was probably nothing.”

**

It wasn’t until we left the forest and the tires finally hit asphalt did I finally take a breath. We were almost there. Jack’s cabin sat almost directly in the center between the town of Willow Creek and the Hoopa Indian Reservation, and alongside the very edge of the Six Rivers National Forest.

We were heading to the small town of Burnt Towers. Burnt Towers was a tiny, unincorporated town of only 300 individuals. However, the proximity to Six Rivers; and the breathtaking; rolling hills of green in the summer, and the changing leaves in the fall, made it an extremely popular tourist spot.

Legend has it that Burnt Towers got its name from a pair of enormous structures that suddenly appeared at the entrance of the town almost two hundred years ago. Seemingly overnight, these forty-feet tall monstrosities were erected without nary a clue as to who actually built them.

And there they stood, until one night, at 3 o’clock in the morning, the locals woke up to them entirely engulfed in flames. The fire was massive, hot, and raging out of control. There was nothing anybody could do. The fire service from the nearby town of Cedar Flats had been called but by the time they’d gotten here, it was too late. The towers had completely burnt down.

Hence, the name. Burnt Towers.

Burnt Towers had one main road in town. There was a gas station, a bank, a grocery store, a hardware store, several stores filled with outdoor and hiking-type gear, and several restaurants. There were a few speakeasies and dive bars too, but they were located a little further down. There were five main offshoots from the downtown area; mainly neighborhoods, which is where all the locals lived, and hotels. The park that we used to play at was back here too.

Jack’s cabin was located off one of those main offshoots. It was located a few miles outside town, at the very top of a large hill. It was just as beautiful as I remembered; a large, white Victorian-style cabin with flowers climbing the large columns that stood on either side of the front door. The flowers climbed the side of the house, and spilled out onto the large, wrap-around porch.

This place had been built with love. Jack’s dad had built it for Jack’s mom, after she’d been diagnosed with a rare kidney disorder almost thirty years ago. “A good luck charm,” he called it. It must’ve worked, because after moving to Grovefield, Jack’s mom had managed to outlast the diagnosis for almost thirty years. “A living medical miracle,” they called her, until she passed away almost fourteen years ago.

**

I turned my phone over, the white light brightening the dim back patio. The screen clicked on. Nothing. “Of course,” I muttered, as my heart sank.

Jack hadn’t texted me. I shouldn’t be surprised. Despite what he’d said to me, almost ten hours ago in the parking lot of the Tuolumne Hospital, I doubt he was actually still considering meeting us. There was too much going on for him to just drop everything. He had work, he had school, he had his girlfriend.. I shook my head.

But I couldn’t help but feel the echoes of his words. I could see him in my mind’s eye, and my cheek still burned from where he’d touched it. Of course, I’m meeting you, Aimee. He’d said to me in that parking lot. He’d promised me. Somebody has to finish fixing you up.

I shook my head again, hard. Fuck, I couldn’t afford to think like that now and I took a sip of tea to clear my head. It clicked gently on the patio table, next to the binders from Arjun’s basement.

They were the ones I’d snatched, desperately, before we were forced to make a break for it. They were filled with maps, missing persons reports dating back almost sixty years ago, and pages and pages of tightly-packed, handwritten notes. I didn’t understand it and frankly, it was making my head hurt. I shook my head again. I needed Arjun to wake up and explain.

With a sigh, I sat back in my seat, thinking about everything that’d transpired in the last two days. “Three weeks.” I murmured quietly to myself. “What’s happening in three weeks?” Monroe was sitting outside with me, and she was tilting her head back and forth, as if she was listening. I looked down at her. “I don’t suppose you know what Louise’s dad meant when he said, ‘it’s happening in three weeks?’”

Monroe cocked her head and let out a low woof. I laughed.

“I don’t know either, girl.” I rubbed my temples hard, feeling the bones of my knuckles grind against my skull. “Of course, except for one thing.” Monroe was still watching me, her eyes intently focused on mine. “The anniversary of Paula’s disappearance.” I sighed again. “And at the rate everything’s going, I’m sure something fucking horrible is going to happen.”

I reached over for the teacup, accidentally swatting a firefly that’d landed on it. “Oh, I’m sorry little guy.” I whispered as I pulled my hand away. It flew away, dipping and weaving, like a drunk man leaving a bar. I looked up. The whole backyard was filled with them.

The fireflies looked like flickering stars, coming down for a brief visit. It was… beautiful. With how they clustered around the tops of trees and in the bushes and grass, it looked like the entire backyard was on fire. Ugh. I rubbed my temples again. My head was killing me.

This headache had started not long after the little… drive through Sweet Hollow Pass. I used to get these horrible, mind-splitting headaches as a kid. The kind where it felt like something fat and horrible had taken a shit on your brain, and had also left behind something that was now slowly hatching inside your skull. For months, my mom had been convinced it was just migraines. “Migraines?” Doctors questioned, perplexed; when my dad finally took me in. “But… what four year-old gets migraines?”

Of course, it probably didn’t help that I was introduced to Xanax not long after this.

I dug my fingernails into my thigh, forcing the fog to part and my head to clear. Look. I thought to myself. It’s been almost six years since I’d gotten one.This is probably just… stress-related. I tilted the teacup back, chugging the rest of it. I’d go buy some Advil in the morning.

“Come on Monroe.” I tapped my thigh, motioning to her, and headed inside, locking the patio door behind me.

**

By the time I woke up, my headache had gotten worse. Instead of just the throbbing headache from last night; it now felt like my brain was trying to dismember itself piece by piece, and squeeze the brain tissue through both ear canals.

I sat up, clutching my head. “Fuckkk.” I moaned. My feet touched the bare hardwood floors, and I shivered. It was freezing. I heaved myself up and stumbled around, searching in vain for the keys. In my haste, I accidentally smacked into Mornoe, who was laying at the foot of the bed.

She let out a loud woof, throwing me an incredibly judgemental look. I laughed. It was the same look she used to give me when in high-school I’d sneak in through the oversize doggy-door to sleep at Arjun’s, because I was high as a kite and avoiding my dad. But I knew what would change her mind.

“Wanna go for a ride?”

**

The bell dinged as I walked into Ms. Kees General Store. Burnt Towers was empty this morning; as apparently 7 in the morning was still a little early for people, I guess.

The scent of pine needles, deck stain, and leather oil pulled me in like a hug, and I took a deep sniff. I let it out. Ahhhhh. Everything was exactly the same. The lines of fishing poles stacked against the far wall. The cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling and filled with packets of ramen, cereal and the protein bars that always crumbled into dust everytime you bit into them. This is where we used to get our gear for the long camping trips that were the hallmark of our summers in Burnt Towers. I bet if I looked, I could find the old aluminum flask that Jack and I had hidden inside one of the popcorn ceiling tiles when I worked here during the summer before our sophomore year.

That flask of Jameson kept me blessedly numb from the chaos that always came with the crazy summer tourist months.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Suddenly, I heard the familiar sound of spurs on a hardwood floor. “Is that… Ms. Aimee I see lurking around my store again?”

I felt myself light up into a smile. “Ms. Kees!” I cried. She was in the back of the store, smoking a cigarette behind the cash registers. A Marlboro Light: I’d recognize that plume of smoke anywhere. She used to go through a pack a day. “Despite all efforts from local authorities, you just couldn’t keep me away,” I laughed.

She tapped the cigarette in her trademark ceramic cowboy hat ashtray, ashing it. “Mhmmm.” She grumbled. “I can remember a time or two when the cops came calling to my door.” She cracked a grin. “And you ain’t even my baby!”

“What’ll it be today, sweetheart?” She slapped both hands on the thick, carved desk. “Look.” She eagerly pointed. “We’ve got some new items I think you’d be interested in.” She held up a silver-and-red, latest edition S14 German Swiss Army Knife. “Brand new, and fresh off the boat..”

“No, no.” I begged her off, holding up my hands. “Not today. Just these.” On the counter I had set a jumbo-size bottle of Advil and a bag of Purina dog food.

“Advil, huh?” She rested one sharp eye on me. “You’re getting headaches again?” Her brow furrowed as her dark gray eyebrows pulled together. She looked… concerned. Her gray hair, which I could remember used to be the same shade as her smokey, dark brown eyes, was pulled back into a severe bun. Her tanned, olive skin contrasted sharply against the thick, white cable knit sweater she had on. “I thought those had gone away?”

“Mhmmm.” I winced again. The headache was beginning to pick up speed, like a storm gathering in the horizon. I cracked open the bottle and quickly downed a couple, hoping that this would stave it off. But as the pills slid down my throat, I suddenly felt a strong wave of dizziness. “Whew.” I swallowed hard, as everything threatened to come back up. “I’m sorry, is there somewhere I can sit down?”

“Uh, sure hun.” Ms. Kees’s spurs clinked as she pulled me around and into the back office. I felt her hands on my shoulders as she half-pushed, and I half-fell, into an uncomfortable, straight-backed chair. I tried to swallow, wincing painfully as my throat felt dry and scratchy. Ms. Kees noticed.

“Sit tight,” She cried. “Let me get you some water too.”

Fuckkk, my head was throbbing. Pressing the palms of my hands against my temples, I sighed and looked around. Literally nothing had changed since the last time I was here.

A large shelving unit, filling almost the entire back wall, was filled with cardboard boxes of inventory. Fishing gear, clothing items, hats, etc. Next to the shelving unit, was a small propped-up card table that we considered our “breakroom.” Considering that it was just a mini-fridge and a microwave on a fold-out table, Jack always used to joke that “we were one smelly fish sandwich away from total disaster.”

But, wait. I paused. This was new. I got up and walked over for a better look. I felt dizzy, as all the blood rushed to my head.

HAVE YOU SEEN ME? screamed down at me from a hundred different posters. MISSING. Hundreds of faces jumped out at me. Men, women, children: it looked like every age and race was up on that board. Ms. Kees had hung a giant, orange cork board that was filled with missing posters.

Stunned, and momentarily forgetting the roaring headache, I reached up to trace the face of a missing child. “Betty Ingram,” I read, my voice catching my throat. “Ten years old, missing in Yosemite National Park.” I read another one. “Patricia Rose, aged 45 years old. Last seen in Six Rivers National Park.” My voice cracked. “Tom Parker. Twenty-one years old. Reported missing after friends woke up to find him gone from their campsite in Tahoe National Forest.”

I checked the dates. A shiver ran through me. These were all dated from the past ten years. “Beatrice Montclair, aged 31. Reported missing after she didn’t return from a hike in…” I paused. “In Yosemite National Park, on the Glacier Point Trail.” I felt my brain churning. I stared at her photo.

“What happened to you?” I whispered. Her dark eyes stared back at me, saying nothing. The longer I stared at her, the worse my headache was getting. I felt tears rise in the back of my throat; as I suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to cry. Her picture blurred, as they clouded my vision. What the fuck was happening out in Yosemite National Park?

Fuck. I cupped my ears. The pressure in my head had gotten so bad, that my ears were starting to ring. It sounded shrill, high-pitched, and like tuning into a TV channel where someone was being brutally murdered. I grimaced, glancing back at Beatrice’s picture. Is this what you sounded like right before you disappeared?

Then as if in response to my question, her picture suddenly moved.

**

I gasped. “No. No. Nonononono.” I muttered frantically, screwing my eyes shut. My brain felt like it was on fire, the pressure in my ears was becoming unbearable and most of all, I just couldn’t believe that this was happening again.

It's been years since… Shit, no. Stop. I wouldn’t let myself think about it. I backed away from the wall, feeling behind me for the chair. My knee hit the corner of the filing cabinet hard, but I didn’t dare open my eyes. My heart was pounding furiously, where was my bag?

“Aimee?”

My eyes flew open. Ms. Kees was standing in the doorway. “Is everything alright?” She asked, looking uneasy. I must’ve looked silly, walking backwards with my eyes shut like that. She had a bottle of water in one hand, and a hot water bottle in the other.

“I’m fine!” I chirped, forcing a smile on my face. “Sorry about that, I’m feeling a lot better.” I headed out towards the front door, my heart pounding. “I’ll call you once I’m settled in!” I could hear her calling out to me as I stumbled towards the front door, but I couldn’t stop. I could feel Beatrice’s eyes watching me as I walked out.

**

In a daze, I burst onto a busy sidewalk. Burnt Towers was bustling now. The shops were open, the diner I’d parked in-front of was packed and people were racing around, getting ready to hit the trails early.

In the morning light, flush against the normalcy of people going to breakfast with their families, the Pontiac looked bad. I winced, seeing heads turn as I opened the driver’s side door and I knew they were looking at the busted passenger window and the twisted chunks of metal and glass. I knew I should care, but I didn’t.

I couldn’t care. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t breathe. My stomach roiled and flipped, as a kaleidoscope of emotion cycled through my brain. The headache had gotten worse, those two Advil I’d taken in Ms. Kees’s shop be damned, and the pain ebbed and flowed with the pulse of my blood. I fought back tears as I couldn’t believe this was happening again.

“No.” I whispered. “Stop. Don’t cry.” I shut my eyes tightly and gripped the steering wheel. “You’re gonna make it worse.” I could feel my knuckles starting to turn white. It didn’t help that I everytime I closed my eyes, everytime I blinked, I could see Beatrice’s face. I could still see what it looked like the second it started to move.

“FUCK. Stop.”

“STOP. Okay stop.” I reached over to grab Monroe. “Dude, girl stop barking.” Monroe was sitting in the passenger seat and she was absolutely losing her mind. “GIRL this isn’t helping.” People were sitting next to us at the patio tables of Lucky Dave’s Local Spot, and I could feel the heat of the stares from the entire restaurant. I grabbed her collar in an attempt to calm her down.

“Girl, what the fuck are you even barking at-”

My voice trailed off. My blood went cold. I saw where she was looking.

There was something standing behind the dumpsters at the end of the street. I leaned forward, my eyes straining. For a minute, there was nothing. Just a quiet alleyway, behind the local drugstore. There. Slowly, as I watched, something peeked over the lid of the dumpsters. Then suddenly, it ducked back down.

Like it was trying to hide.

Monroe started growling again. The back of my neck started tingling. A cold sweat suddenly broke out, and I felt the ground suddenly drop out from underneath me. I’d recognize that hair anywhere.

This was the same thing I’d seen back in Sweet Hollow Pass. The thing that looked like me. I smashed my eyes shut, grinding the heel of my hands into my eyes. Fuck, the building pressure in my head threatened to pop my eyes like grapes. “Please be gone, please be gone. Please be gone.” I sobbed.

Then I stopped. Breathing in a shuddering, steeling sense of resolve, I gingerly opened them back up. Nothing.

My mind felt splintered, chaotic; and like all the pieces were slowly falling apart. I felt trapped, cornered. Like how a field mouse must feel when being stalked by a hawk. I took another big, shuddering breath in. I looked over at Monroe; she was looking at me, with all the fur standing up on her back. Reaching out, I put my hand on her soft, jet-black head, she was shaking. “Let’s get out of here,” I whispered.

**

The drive home felt agonizingly long. It didn’t help that my head was pounding, and my phone was practically ringing nonstop. Whoever this was, they’d called me like ten times in the past five minutes. Without looking, I turned off the ringer and tossed it into the footwell of the passenger seat.

It wasn’t five minutes later, when I finally pulled into the winding driveway that led past a pair of massive Douglas Firs and up to Jack’s cabin. To my surprise, Arjun was waiting for me outside. He barely waited for me to park before he threw open my door.

“Aimee, I’ve been calling you.” He said, with one balled-up fist on his hip. “Literally like twenty times. You can’t just not pick up. There’s something we need-.”

“Oh, that was you.” I mumbled, shoving him aside. The bag from Ms. Kees’s swung wide and hit me hard, the Advil digging into my hip bone. “I texted and told you I was going into town.”

“Yeah, that was me.” He sounded mad. Arjun tried to follow me, but the bulky cast on his leg slowed him down. “But that’s not what we need to talk about. Aimee listen-”

“Can this wait until after a nap?” I could feel my body shutting down. The events from this morning were catching up to me and I needed at least ten more Advil in me. I walked up to the front door, with Monroe bouncing up the steps next to me. “WAIT, Aimee!” I could hear Arjun crying out right behind me. “WAIT there’s something I need to tell you-”

**

I swung open the front door, to find a mountain of suitcases in the foyer. My heart stopped.

“Oh.” I said quietly.

“-They’re here.” Arjun huffed. He’d finally caught up to me. The red bathrobe he was wearing flapped as he heaved himself up the steps. “They got in about an hour ago.” I could feel the wheels turning in my head. “Arjun.” I said slowly. “Who’s they?”

Suddenly, I heard a voice that I never thought I’d hear again. A voice that I knew belonged to my best friend in the entire world, until three years ago when she threatened to shoot me if I didn’t leave her house and never come back. And rightfully so.

“Oh hell no.” She cried. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.” I winced. “Hi Louise.”

“What is she doing here.” Louise growled. Every syntax in her voice positively dripped with venom. They were all in the living room. Patrice, Mikey, Jack… The old gang was all here. Jack had brought everybody. I was stunned. I watched as she turned to Jack. “You told me she wasn’t going to be here.”

I looked at Arjun. His face looked ashen, and his eyes wheeled wildly between me and Louise. I took a deep breath. “I think now is a good time to take a nap.”

“Aimee. AIMEE.”

“Huh?” I suddenly snapped back to Arjun hitting my shoulder. Hard. “Wh… what’s going on?”

“You tell me.” Arjun said, uneasily. He was sitting leaning over me, and had my shoulder in a death grip. “You were zoned out and staring straight ahead. I just woke up to find us sitting in the middle of freakin’ Sweet Hollow Pass.”

The girl in the road. I whipped around, my heart beating furiously and my eyes searching desperately. There was no sign of her. I could feel the engine humming underneath my shaking hands. “The girl! Did you see her?”

“See who?” Arjun said quietly, his eyes never leaving me. “The girl! She looked like-” I whipped around again, searching valiantly around the car. Nothing. No trace of her. “-Looked like me.”

“She looked like…. you?” Arjun said cautiously. “Aimee…” He said quietly. “Are you seeing things?” I swallowed uneasily. Had I fallen asleep without realizing it? While driving? But it felt so real.

Cautiously, I settled back into my seat. Heart pounding, I tried to put a lid on the wild panic I felt in my chest. Carefully keeping my expression neutral, I put the car back into drive. “You’re right.” I said quietly. “It was probably nothing.”

**

It wasn’t until we left the forest and the tires finally hit asphalt did I finally take a breath. We were almost there. Jack’s cabin sat almost directly in the center between the town of Willow Creek and the Hoopa Indian Reservation, and alongside the very edge of the Six Rivers National Forest.

We were heading to the small town of Burnt Towers. Burnt Towers was a tiny, unincorporated town of only 300 individuals. However, the proximity to Six Rivers; and the breathtaking; rolling hills of green in the summer, and the changing leaves in the fall, made it an extremely popular tourist spot.

Legend has it that Burnt Towers got its name from a pair of enormous structures that suddenly appeared at the entrance of the town almost two hundred years ago. Seemingly overnight, these forty-feet tall monstrosities were erected without nary a clue as to who actually built them.

And there they stood, until one night, at 3 o’clock in the morning, the locals woke up to them entirely engulfed in flames. The fire was massive, hot, and raging out of control. There was nothing anybody could do. The fire service from the nearby town of Cedar Flats had been called but by the time they’d gotten here, it was too late. The towers had completely burnt down.

Hence, the name. Burnt Towers.

Burnt Towers had one main road in town. There was a gas station, a bank, a grocery store, a hardware store, several stores filled with outdoor and hiking-type gear, and several restaurants. There were a few speakeasies and dive bars too, but they were located a little further down. There were five main offshoots from the downtown area; mainly neighborhoods, which is where all the locals lived, and hotels. The park that we used to play at was back here too.

Jack’s cabin was located off one of those main offshoots. It was located a few miles outside town, at the very top of a large hill. It was just as beautiful as I remembered; a large, white Victorian-style cabin with flowers climbing the large columns that stood on either side of the front door. The flowers climbed the side of the house, and spilled out onto the large, wrap-around porch.

This place had been built with love. Jack’s dad had built it for Jack’s mom, after she’d been diagnosed with a rare kidney disorder almost thirty years ago. “A good luck charm,” he called it. It must’ve worked, because after moving to Grovefield, Jack’s mom had managed to outlast the diagnosis for almost thirty years. “A living medical miracle,” they called her, until she passed away almost fourteen years ago.

**

I turned my phone over, the white light brightening the dim back patio. The screen clicked on. Nothing. “Of course,” I muttered, as my heart sank.

Jack hadn’t texted me. I shouldn’t be surprised. Despite what he’d said to me, almost ten hours ago in the parking lot of the Tuolumne Hospital, I doubt he was actually still considering meeting us. There was too much going on for him to just drop everything. He had work, he had school, he had his girlfriend.. I shook my head.

But I couldn’t help but feel the echoes of his words. I could see him in my mind’s eye, and my cheek still burned from where he’d touched it. Of course, I’m meeting you, Aimee. He’d said to me in that parking lot. He’d promised me. Somebody has to finish fixing you up.

I shook my head again, hard. Fuck, I couldn’t afford to think like that now and I took a sip of tea to clear my head. It clicked gently on the patio table, next to the binders from Arjun’s basement.

They were the ones I’d snatched, desperately, before we were forced to make a break for it. They were filled with maps, missing persons reports dating back almost sixty years ago, and pages and pages of tightly-packed, handwritten notes. I didn’t understand it and frankly, it was making my head hurt. I shook my head again. I needed Arjun to wake up and explain.

With a sigh, I sat back in my seat, thinking about everything that’d transpired in the last two days. “Three weeks.” I murmured quietly to myself. “What’s happening in three weeks?” Monroe was sitting outside with me, and she was tilting her head back and forth, as if she was listening. I looked down at her. “I don’t suppose you know what Louise’s dad meant when he said, ‘it’s happening in three weeks?’”

Monroe cocked her head and let out a low woof. I laughed.

“I don’t know either, girl.” I rubbed my temples hard, feeling the bones of my knuckles grind against my skull. “Of course, except for one thing.” Monroe was still watching me, her eyes intently focused on mine. “The anniversary of Paula’s disappearance.” I sighed again. “And at the rate everything’s going, I’m sure something fucking horrible is going to happen.”

I reached over for the teacup, accidentally swatting a firefly that’d landed on it. “Oh, I’m sorry little guy.” I whispered as I pulled my hand away. It flew away, dipping and weaving, like a drunk man leaving a bar. I looked up. The whole backyard was filled with them.

The fireflies looked like flickering stars, coming down for a brief visit. It was… beautiful. With how they clustered around the tops of trees and in the bushes and grass, it looked like the entire backyard was on fire. Ugh. I rubbed my temples again. My head was killing me.

This headache had started not long after the little… drive through Sweet Hollow Pass. I used to get these horrible, mind-splitting headaches as a kid. The kind where it felt like something fat and horrible had taken a shit on your brain, and had also left behind something that was now slowly hatching inside your skull. For months, my mom had been convinced it was just migraines. “Migraines?” Doctors questioned, perplexed; when my dad finally took me in. “But… what four year-old gets migraines?”

Of course, it probably didn’t help that I was introduced to Xanax not long after this.

I dug my fingernails into my thigh, forcing the fog to part and my head to clear. Look. I thought to myself. It’s been almost six years since I’d gotten one.This is probably just… stress-related. I tilted the teacup back, chugging the rest of it. I’d go buy some Advil in the morning.

“Come on Monroe.” I tapped my thigh, motioning to her, and headed inside, locking the patio door behind me.

**

By the time I woke up, my headache had gotten worse. Instead of just the throbbing headache from last night; it now felt like my brain was trying to dismember itself piece by piece, and squeeze the brain tissue through both ear canals.

I sat up, clutching my head. “Fuckkk.” I moaned. My feet touched the bare hardwood floors, and I shivered. It was freezing. I heaved myself up and stumbled around, searching in vain for the keys. In my haste, I accidentally smacked into Mornoe, who was laying at the foot of the bed.

She let out a loud woof, throwing me an incredibly judgemental look. I laughed. It was the same look she used to give me when in high-school I’d sneak in through the oversize doggy-door to sleep at Arjun’s, because I was high as a kite and avoiding my dad. But I knew what would change her mind.

“Wanna go for a ride?”

**

The bell dinged as I walked into Ms. Kees General Store. Burnt Towers was empty this morning; as apparently 7 in the morning was still a little early for people, I guess.

The scent of pine needles, deck stain, and leather oil pulled me in like a hug, and I took a deep sniff. I let it out. Ahhhhh. Everything was exactly the same. The lines of fishing poles stacked against the far wall. The cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling and filled with packets of ramen, cereal and the protein bars that always crumbled into dust everytime you bit into them. This is where we used to get our gear for the long camping trips that were the hallmark of our summers in Burnt Towers. I bet if I looked, I could find the old aluminum flask that Jack and I had hidden inside one of the popcorn ceiling tiles when I worked here during the summer before our sophomore year.

That flask of Jameson kept me blessedly numb from the chaos that always came with the crazy summer tourist months.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Suddenly, I heard the familiar sound of spurs on a hardwood floor. “Is that… Ms. Aimee I see lurking around my store again?”

I felt myself light up into a smile. “Ms. Kees!” I cried. She was in the back of the store, smoking a cigarette behind the cash registers. A Marlboro Light: I’d recognize that plume of smoke anywhere. She used to go through a pack a day. “Despite all efforts from local authorities, you just couldn’t keep me away,” I laughed.

She tapped the cigarette in her trademark ceramic cowboy hat ashtray, ashing it. “Mhmmm.” She grumbled. “I can remember a time or two when the cops came calling to my door.” She cracked a grin. “And you ain’t even my baby!”

“What’ll it be today, sweetheart?” She slapped both hands on the thick, carved desk. “Look.” She eagerly pointed. “We’ve got some new items I think you’d be interested in.” She held up a silver-and-red, latest edition S14 German Swiss Army Knife. “Brand new, and fresh off the boat..”

“No, no.” I begged her off, holding up my hands. “Not today. Just these.” On the counter I had set a jumbo-size bottle of Advil and a bag of Purina dog food.

“Advil, huh?” She rested one sharp eye on me. “You’re getting headaches again?” Her brow furrowed as her dark gray eyebrows pulled together. She looked… concerned. Her gray hair, which I could remember used to be the same shade as her smokey, dark brown eyes, was pulled back into a severe bun. Her tanned, olive skin contrasted sharply against the thick, white cable knit sweater she had on. “I thought those had gone away?”

“Mhmmm.” I winced again. The headache was beginning to pick up speed, like a storm gathering in the horizon. I cracked open the bottle and quickly downed a couple, hoping that this would stave it off. But as the pills slid down my throat, I suddenly felt a strong wave of dizziness. “Whew.” I swallowed hard, as everything threatened to come back up. “I’m sorry, is there somewhere I can sit down?”

“Uh, sure hun.” Ms. Kees’s spurs clinked as she pulled me around and into the back office. I felt her hands on my shoulders as she half-pushed, and I half-fell, into an uncomfortable, straight-backed chair. I tried to swallow, wincing painfully as my throat felt dry and scratchy. Ms. Kees noticed.

“Sit tight,” She cried. “Let me get you some water too.”

Fuckkk, my head was throbbing. Pressing the palms of my hands against my temples, I sighed and looked around. Literally nothing had changed since the last time I was here.

A large shelving unit, filling almost the entire back wall, was filled with cardboard boxes of inventory. Fishing gear, clothing items, hats, etc. Next to the shelving unit, was a small propped-up card table that we considered our “breakroom.” Considering that it was just a mini-fridge and a microwave on a fold-out table, Jack always used to joke that “we were one smelly fish sandwich away from total disaster.”

But, wait. I paused. This was new. I got up and walked over for a better look. I felt dizzy, as all the blood rushed to my head.

HAVE YOU SEEN ME? screamed down at me from a hundred different posters. MISSING. Hundreds of faces jumped out at me. Men, women, children: it looked like every age and race was up on that board. Ms. Kees had hung a giant, orange cork board that was filled with missing posters.

Stunned, and momentarily forgetting the roaring headache, I reached up to trace the face of a missing child. “Betty Ingram,” I read, my voice catching my throat. “Ten years old, missing in Yosemite National Park.” I read another one. “Patricia Rose, aged 45 years old. Last seen in Six Rivers National Park.” My voice cracked. “Tom Parker. Twenty-one years old. Reported missing after friends woke up to find him gone from their campsite in Tahoe National Forest.”

I checked the dates. A shiver ran through me. These were all dated from the past ten years. “Beatrice Montclair, aged 31. Reported missing after she didn’t return from a hike in…” I paused. “In Yosemite National Park, on the Glacier Point Trail.” I felt my brain churning. I stared at her photo.

“What happened to you?” I whispered. Her dark eyes stared back at me, saying nothing. The longer I stared at her, the worse my headache was getting. I felt tears rise in the back of my throat; as I suddenly felt an overwhelming urge to cry. Her picture blurred, as they clouded my vision. What the fuck was happening out in Yosemite National Park?

Fuck. I cupped my ears. The pressure in my head had gotten so bad, that my ears were starting to ring. It sounded shrill, high-pitched, and like tuning into a TV channel where someone was being brutally murdered. I grimaced, glancing back at Beatrice’s picture. Is this what you sounded like right before you disappeared?

Then as if in response to my question, her picture suddenly moved.

**

I gasped. “No. No. Nonononono.” I muttered frantically, screwing my eyes shut. My brain felt like it was on fire, the pressure in my ears was becoming unbearable and most of all, I just couldn’t believe that this was happening again.

It's been years since… Shit, no. Stop. I wouldn’t let myself think about it. I backed away from the wall, feeling behind me for the chair. My knee hit the corner of the filing cabinet hard, but I didn’t dare open my eyes. My heart was pounding furiously, where was my bag?

“Aimee?”

My eyes flew open. Ms. Kees was standing in the doorway. “Is everything alright?” She asked, looking uneasy. I must’ve looked silly, walking backwards with my eyes shut like that. She had a bottle of water in one hand, and a hot water bottle in the other.

“I’m fine!” I chirped, forcing a smile on my face. “Sorry about that, I’m feeling a lot better.” I headed out towards the front door, my heart pounding. “I’ll call you once I’m settled in!” I could hear her calling out to me as I stumbled towards the front door, but I couldn’t stop. I could feel Beatrice’s eyes watching me as I walked out.

**

In a daze, I burst onto a busy sidewalk. Burnt Towers was bustling now. The shops were open, the diner I’d parked in-front of was packed and people were racing around, getting ready to hit the trails early.

In the morning light, flush against the normalcy of people going to breakfast with their families, the Pontiac looked bad. I winced, seeing heads turn as I opened the driver’s side door and I knew they were looking at the busted passenger window and the twisted chunks of metal and glass. I knew I should care, but I didn’t.

I couldn’t care. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t breathe. My stomach roiled and flipped, as a kaleidoscope of emotion cycled through my brain. The headache had gotten worse, those two Advil I’d taken in Ms. Kees’s shop be damned, and the pain ebbed and flowed with the pulse of my blood. I fought back tears as I couldn’t believe this was happening again.

“No.” I whispered. “Stop. Don’t cry.” I shut my eyes tightly and gripped the steering wheel. “You’re gonna make it worse.” I could feel my knuckles starting to turn white. It didn’t help that I everytime I closed my eyes, everytime I blinked, I could see Beatrice’s face. I could still see what it looked like the second it started to move.

“FUCK. Stop.”

“STOP. Okay stop.” I reached over to grab Monroe. “Dude, girl stop barking.” Monroe was sitting in the passenger seat and she was absolutely losing her mind. “GIRL this isn’t helping.” People were sitting next to us at the patio tables of Lucky Dave’s Local Spot, and I could feel the heat of the stares from the entire restaurant. I grabbed her collar in an attempt to calm her down.

“Girl, what the fuck are you even barking at-”

My voice trailed off. My blood went cold. I saw where she was looking.

There was something standing behind the dumpsters at the end of the street. I leaned forward, my eyes straining. For a minute, there was nothing. Just a quiet alleyway, behind the local drugstore. There. Slowly, as I watched, something peeked over the lid of the dumpsters. Then suddenly, it ducked back down.

Like it was trying to hide.

Monroe started growling again. The back of my neck started tingling. A cold sweat suddenly broke out, and I felt the ground suddenly drop out from underneath me. I’d recognize that hair anywhere.

This was the same thing I’d seen back in Sweet Hollow Pass. The thing that looked like me. I smashed my eyes shut, grinding the heel of my hands into my eyes. Fuck, the building pressure in my head threatened to pop my eyes like grapes. “Please be gone, please be gone. Please be gone.” I sobbed.

Then I stopped. Breathing in a shuddering, steeling sense of resolve, I gingerly opened them back up. Nothing.

My mind felt splintered, chaotic; and like all the pieces were slowly falling apart. I felt trapped, cornered. Like how a field mouse must feel when being stalked by a hawk. I took another big, shuddering breath in. I looked over at Monroe; she was looking at me, with all the fur standing up on her back. Reaching out, I put my hand on her soft, jet-black head, she was shaking. “Let’s get out of here,” I whispered.

**

The drive home felt agonizingly long. It didn’t help that my head was pounding, and my phone was practically ringing nonstop. Whoever this was, they’d called me like ten times in the past five minutes. Without looking, I turned off the ringer and tossed it into the footwell of the passenger seat.

It wasn’t five minutes later, when I finally pulled into the winding driveway that led past a pair of massive Douglas Firs and up to Jack’s cabin. To my surprise, Arjun was waiting for me outside. He barely waited for me to park before he threw open my door.

“Aimee, I’ve been calling you.” He said, with one balled-up fist on his hip. “Literally like twenty times. You can’t just not pick up. There’s something we need-.”

“Oh, that was you.” I mumbled, shoving him aside. The bag from Ms. Kees’s swung wide and hit me hard, the Advil digging into my hip bone. “I texted and told you I was going into town.”

“Yeah, that was me.” He sounded mad. Arjun tried to follow me, but the bulky cast on his leg slowed him down. “But that’s not what we need to talk about. Aimee listen-”

“Can this wait until after a nap?” I could feel my body shutting down. The events from this morning were catching up to me and I needed at least ten more Advil in me. I walked up to the front door, with Monroe bouncing up the steps next to me. “WAIT, Aimee!” I could hear Arjun crying out right behind me. “WAIT there’s something I need to tell you-”

**

I swung open the front door, to find a mountain of suitcases in the foyer. My heart stopped.

“Oh.” I said quietly.

“-They’re here.” Arjun huffed. He’d finally caught up to me. The red bathrobe he was wearing flapped as he heaved himself up the steps. “They got in about an hour ago.” I could feel the wheels turning in my head. “Arjun.” I said slowly. “Who’s they?”

Suddenly, I heard a voice that I never thought I’d hear again. A voice that I knew belonged to my best friend in the entire world, until three years ago when she threatened to shoot me if I didn’t leave her house and never come back. And rightfully so.

“Oh hell no.” She cried. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.” I winced. “Hi Louise.”

“What is she doing here.” Louise growled. Every syntax in her voice positively dripped with venom. They were all in the living room. Patrice, Mikey, Jack… The old gang was all here. Jack had brought everybody. I was stunned. I watched as she turned to Jack. “You told me she wasn’t going to be here.”

I looked at Arjun. His face looked ashen, and his eyes wheeled wildly between me and Louise. I took a deep breath. “I think now is a good time to take a nap.”

JUNEAU, Alaska – A woman filmed herself escaping the path of a rockslide near Juneau, Alaska, last week and then frantically rushed to save drivers from getting killed.

Alana Davis was recording footage on TikTok from a beach along the Douglas Highway on April 6 when the rockslide happened.

Video shows her interrupted mid-sentence by a crashing noise. She immediately grabs her camera and runs for safety, waving her arms and shouting at highway traffic to stop.

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop your car!” she yelled while trying to catch her breath.

Davis said a man driving a pickup was about to encounter a blind turn on the highway while traveling at 50 mph.

“Literally 30 seconds from getting killed. Think about that,” the man told Davis.

“I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she replied.

Landslide and debris flow warning signs include a faint rumbling sound that increases in volume and is noticeable as the landslide nears, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.

Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities spokesman Sam Dapcevich said about 500 cubic yards of material fell to the road from a cliff about 500 feet up the hillside near mile 11 of North Douglas Highway on April 6. Crews immediately responded and cleaned up the slide debris to reopen the highway.

On April 10, a second slide took place at the same location with approximately twice the quantity of material reaching the road, including several car-sized boulders that bounced across the road and over the guardrail, finally landing on the beach or in the water.

“Our maintenance and operations foreman was there working on cleanup when the second slide came down, and he took action to keep traffic from passing through,” Dapcevich said.

As of Wednesday, both lanes are cleared, but the road will remain closed while geologists monitor the site. A geotechnical team is gathering imagery with a drone as weather conditions allow.

“It was very windy during both slide events, many tree roots are now exposed that appear to have grown in the rock crevices. The wind moving the trees likely jostled the rock and could have been the cause of both slides. There’s still a lot of rock up there that could come down in the future,” Dapcevich said.

This morning after we'd discovered yesterday we could get out and go restock our supplies and do the other five million things that are on hold -

- only for it to pour rain all night and cut us off again. And more rain is forecast.

Our mental health is deteriorating by the day. Sadly it would be even worse if we'd evacuated; the evacuation situation is dire, because business owners are kicking out flood refugees from caravan parks and holiday lettings to honour holiday bookings. What the fuck. 

There are SO MANY homeless people now. We have a house we can live in, there's no way we'll add to the burden. And the stress of having animals who've lived in the bush all their lives in an evacuation centre, not to mention the sheer chaos for humans like us who don't do well mentally in crowded, noisy conditions...

Oh, and that temporary housing the government promised for those who'd lost their homes? - well you can whistle dixie on that one. 40 mobile homes are hardly going to fix it for a major rural centre and about a dozen outlying towns full of displaced residents with no safe place to return to. Everything else has been empty rhetoric designed to convince those who don't live here that the politicians have the situation under control.

They absolutely do not.

The army are doing some great things in town apparently, but have no clue about rural areas in general or wetlands in particular. We've had naiive young recruits driving semi-flooded dirt roads like they're on a major highway in 12 tonne troop carriers, turning the delicate access tracks on the verges into mudslides and getting themselves bogged by not walking the puddles before they drive through. We've had three visits from them which seemed to be repetitive information gathering, but nobody actually *did* anything here and there doesn't seem to be any centralised organisation to ensure everyone who needs help is checked on ONCE, with a list of their needs taken and then attended to. 

Not saying the army did nothing here; some properties got their flood-destroyed shit piled up on the roadside at their gates (hah! There is no 'roadside' here, this is not a paved road, it's basically a track through the bush) for collection, and you guessed it, it's all still here weeks later, ready to wash away into the bush in the next downpour. We did suggest skip bins to be filled, located at the RFS shed. Nope. Radio silence. Why would you listen to the locals?

This morning someone told me that all the volunteers in town have been told to go home, that some government agency who has no clue about the place will take it from here. I'm hoping it's a rumour but I bet it isn't. It's the volunteers, the locals, who saved lives and reunited people with their pets and fed and clothed people who'd been dragged from their rooftops with only the clothes on their backs for the last 5 weeks. But yeah, f*** off, the 'experts' from the city will fix it. Ask one of them where Bungawalbin or Gibberagee is and my money's on getting a blank look in return.

So yeah. Our world is in chaos up here while the news cycle moves on for the rest of the world. In town it's like a war zone. Out here it's more peaceful, but it's only the other locals who've remembered that people in outlying areas will still need supplies as this rain keeps coming back over and over, and will still need their rubbish picked up and will still need their roads fixed (because they can't even get their dead cars towed away and go out to find a new one, and when it's 30 minutes' drive to the nearest supply point and an hour to the hospital you kind of need a car).

Anyway. Today we were going out for essentials. Milk, bread, bog paper, fresh fruit and veg because flood drop supplies are great in an emergency but you'd die of scurvy living off them for months on end. And we can't, and probably won't be able to for god knows how long. 

We'll be okay, we've got longlife milk and we can make bread and we've got limes to stick in our drinks to keep the scurvy away lol... and we'll bump another turkey off soon because the meat's getting low. But this isn't resilience any more, it's basic survival, and we are less okay by the day.

And no, thanks, there's nothing you can do except keep making noise about follow-ups to government promises and keep checking the news to find out what's happening up here and keep thinking of us.

Welcome to climate change.

only for it to pour rain all night and cut us off again. And more rain is forecast.

Our mental health is deteriorating by the day. Sadly it would be even worse if we'd evacuated; the evacuation situation is dire, because business owners are kicking out flood refugees from caravan parks and holiday lettings to honour holiday bookings. What the fuck.

There are SO MANY homeless people now. We have a house we can live in, there's no way we'll add to the burden. And the stress of having animals who've lived in the bush all their lives in an evacuation centre, not to mention the sheer chaos for humans like us who don't do well mentally in crowded, noisy conditions...

Oh, and that temporary housing the government promised for those who'd lost their homes? - well you can whistle dixie on that one. 40 mobile homes are hardly going to fix it for a major rural centre and about a dozen outlying towns full of displaced residents with no safe place to return to. Everything else has been empty rhetoric designed to convince those who don't live here that the politicians have the situation under control.

They absolutely do not.

The army are doing some great things in town apparently, but have no clue about rural areas in general or wetlands in particular. We've had naiive young recruits driving semi-flooded dirt roads like they're on a major highway in 12 tonne troop carriers, turning the delicate access tracks on the verges into mudslides and getting themselves bogged by not walking the puddles before they drive through. We've had three visits from them which seemed to be repetitive information gathering, but nobody actually did anything here and there doesn't seem to be any centralised organisation to ensure everyone who needs help is checked on ONCE, with a list of their needs taken and then attended to.

Not saying the army did nothing here; some properties got their flood-destroyed shit piled up on the roadside at their gates (hah! There is no 'roadside' here, this is not a paved road, it's basically a track through the bush) for collection, and you guessed it, it's all still here weeks later, ready to wash away into the bush in the next downpour. We did suggest skip bins to be filled, located at the RFS shed. Nope. Radio silence. Why would you listen to the locals?

This morning someone told me that all the volunteers in town have been told to go home, that some government agency who has no clue about the place will take it from here. I'm hoping it's a rumour but I bet it isn't. It's the volunteers, the locals, who saved lives and reunited people with their pets and fed and clothed people who'd been dragged from their rooftops with only the clothes on their backs for the last 5 weeks. But yeah, f*** off, the 'experts' from the city will fix it. Ask one of them where Bungawalbin or Gibberagee is and my money's on getting a blank look in return.

So yeah. Our world is in chaos up here while the news cycle moves on for the rest of the world. In town it's like a war zone. Out here it's more peaceful, but it's only the other locals who've remembered that people in outlying areas will still need supplies as this rain keeps coming back over and over, and will still need their rubbish picked up and will still need their roads fixed (because they can't even get their dead cars towed away and go out to find a new one, and when it's 30 minutes' drive to the nearest supply point and an hour to the hospital you kind of need a car).

Anyway. Today we were going out for essentials. Milk, bread, bog paper, fresh fruit and veg because flood drop supplies are great in an emergency but you'd die of scurvy living off them for months on end. And we can't, and probably won't be able to for god knows how long.

We'll be okay, we've got longlife milk and we can make bread and we've got limes to stick in our drinks to keep the scurvy away lol... and we'll bump another turkey off soon because the meat's getting low. But this isn't resilience any more, it's basic survival, and we are less okay by the day.

And no, thanks, there's nothing you can do except keep making noise about follow-ups to government promises and keep checking the news to find out what's happening up here and keep thinking of us.

Welcome to climate change. Have a nice day.","A post from the disaster zone, Northern Rivers, NSW, Australia : CollapseSupport",[],None,,"Reposted from my neighbours Facebook with her permission:

RIO DE JANEIRO — Heavy rains caused mudslides that killed at least 14 people in southerncoastal cities and the Baixada Fluminense area of Rio de Janeiro state, according to state and local authorities on Saturday.

Rescuers answered 850 calls in the last 24 hours and were able to bring 144 people to safety in the affected regions, state authorities said.

Rio de Janeiro has been hit by inclement weather over the past few weeks. Landslides and flooding in February killed some 240 people in the Petropolis area, in the hills above Rio de Janeiro, authorities said on March 23.

“We have more than 70 homeless families. We are providing shelters and renting hostels for these people,” Luciano Vidal, the mayor of Paraty, told Reuters.

He said mudslides blocked streets and isolated parts of the city, and entire neighborhoods were without electricity in the colonial coastal town that is a tourist attraction.

In one day, Paraty received 322 millimeter (12.68 inches) of rain, the rainfall average for six months. At least seven people died there, Vidal said. The civil defense statement only confirmed five deaths in Paraty.

The town, a tourist destination, declared a state of emergency as more rains were forecast.

In nearby Angra dos Reis, also a tourist destination hit by heavy rainfall, at least sixpeople died, the latest state tally showed.

Many were buried in mud as tropical storm Megi brought torrential rain to southern and central areas of the archipelago.

At least 42 people have been killed in heavy rains and landslides caused by tropical storm Megi, the first of the season to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago, as it tore through the central and southern Philippines.

Megi made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65km (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80km/h (50mph). The Philippines usually sees about 20 such storms annually.

Local authorities said at least 36 people died and 26 others were missing after landslides slammed into multiple villages around Baybay City in Leyte province – the hardest hit by the storm. More than 100 people were injured, authorities added.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

“It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that,” said Marissa Miguel Cano, public information officer for Baybay City, where 10 villages have been affected by landslides.

Apple Sheena Bayno was forced to flee after her house in Baybay City flooded. She said her family was still recovering from a super typhoon in December.

“We’re still fixing our house and yet it’s being hit again so I was getting anxious,” she told AFP news agency.

Rescue efforts were also focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Baybay City Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Nearly 200 floods were reported in different areas in central and southern provinces over the weekend, forcing about 30,000 families from their homes, officials said.

Images shared by the local fire bureau on Monday showed rescuers wading through partially submerged homes and digging for survivors in a landslide-hit area.

Tropical storm Megi is expected to weaken to 45km/h (28mph) and move back out over the sea on Tuesday, the state weather bureau said.

The Southeast Asian nation also lies on the Pacific ‘Ring of Fire’, where many of the world’s volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.","Flooding, landslides kill at least 25 people in Philippines",[],2022-04-12 00:00:00,,"Many were buried in mud as tropical storm Megi brought torrential rain to southern and central areas of the archipelago.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummelled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 21 people were dead after landslides slammed into several villages in Leyte province -- one of the hardest hit by the storm -- local authorities said.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Photos showed the rooftops of several homes in Bunga, one of the Leyte communities affected, poking above a river of mud.

Rescue efforts were focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Five people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher to safety.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Jose Carlos Cari, mayor of Leyte’s Baybay City, told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there.”

Cari said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.

“We’re pushing, but we’re having a hard time because it’s dangerous,” he said.

“Equipment has been mobilised, everything is ready, but we’re unable to move because it’s still raining heavily and rivers are still swollen.”

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection officers in the search and rescue efforts.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many people by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

Tropical storm Megi -- known in the Philippines by its local name Agaton -- is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

Whipping up seas, it forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded nearly 8,000 people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The Philippines re-opened to fully vaccinated tourists from most countries in February after lifting practically all Covid-19 restrictions, and Easter is a popular holiday for domestic tourists.

The storm comes four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the archipelago nation, killing more than 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Heavy rains caused by a summer tropical depression have killed at least 25 people in the central and southern Philippines, mostly due to landslides.

Twenty-two people died in landslides in four villages in Baybay city in central Leyte province on Sunday and Monday, city police chief Lieut Col Joemen Collado said. At least six other people were reported missing in the landslides and a search was under way, he said.

Three other storm-related deaths were reported by the government's main disaster-response agency in the southern provinces of Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental.

“In one village, a landslide occurred and other victims, unfortunately, were also swept away by the surge of water,” Lieut Col Collado told the DZBB radio network. “There were at least six missing but there could be more.”

Nearly 200 floods were reported in different areas in central and southern provinces over the weekend, displacing about 30,000 families, some of which were moved to emergency shelters, officials said.

The coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers in flooded communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended on Monday and mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

At least 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year, mostly during the rainy season that begins around June. Some storms have hit even during the scorching summer months in recent years.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs. In central Cebu city, schools and work were suspended Monday and Mayor Michael Rama declared a state of calamity to allow the rapid release of emergency funds.

Two days of heavy rain trigger flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state.

Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state, killing at least eight people including six children and leaving 13 missing, authorities said on Saturday.

Two days of heavy rain have battered a broad swath of the southeastern state’s Atlantic coast, the latest in a series of deadly storms in Brazil that experts have said are being aggravated by climate change.

The latest floods and landslides come six weeks after flash floods and landslides killed 233 people in the scenic city of Petropolis, the Brazilian empire’s 19th-century summer capital, also in Rio state.

This time, the areas hit hardest included the tourist town of Paraty, a seaside colonial city known for its picturesque cobblestone streets and colourful houses.

Officials on Saturday there said a landslide in the Ponta Negra neighbourhood had killed a mother and five of her children, ages two, five, eight, 10 and 15.

A sixth child was rescued alive and taken to the hospital, they said.

In all, seven houses were swept away in landslides in the city, and another four people injured. Seventy-one families were forced from their homes, officials said.

Two more victims were killed in the cities of Mesquita and Angra dos Reis, where another 13 people remain missing, said Congressman Marcelo Freixo, who represents the state of 17.5 million people.

In Angra, the victim was a four-year-old girl buried in a landslide, while in Mesquita, 40km (25 miles) northwest of Rio de Janeiro city, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted trying to help another person escape the flooding, media reports said.

The storms turned streets into rivers in several cities on Friday night, sweeping up cars and triggering landslides – a frequent tragedy in the rainy season, especially in poor hillside communities.

Officials in Angra said the city had received 655 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 48 hours, “levels never before registered in the municipality”.

The federal government said it had sent military aircraft to help the local rescue effort, and dispatched national disaster response secretary Alexandre Lucas to the state.

Experts have said rainy season downpours in Brazil are being augmented by La Nina – the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean – and by the impact of climate change.

As a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

In January, torrential rain triggered floods and landslides that killed at least 28 people in southeastern Brazil, mostly in Sao Paulo state.

There were also heavy rains in the northeastern state of Bahia, where 24 people died in December.","Brazil: Floods and landslides kill eight, 13 missing",[],2022-04-02 00:00:00,,"Two days of heavy rain trigger flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state.

CNN —

At least 14 people were killed, including seven children, after days of heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides in the southeastern Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, the State Civil Defense told CNN Saturday.

Rain showers began Thursday, leading to deadly landslides in the region. The volume of rain registered in the last 48 hours was the highest on record in Angra dos Reis, according to the city’s municipal government.

Officials told affiliate CNN Brazil on Saturday that a landslide in the town of Paraty killed at least eight people – a father and seven of his children – ages 2 to 17. A seventh child was rescued and transported to a hospital, municipal officials told the affiliate.

At least four other people were injured – none seriously – after seven houses were hit by landslides in the coastal community of Ponta Negra, according to officials in Paraty. More than 22 neighborhoods sustained flooding and 71 families were displaced.

In the municipality of Mesquita, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted to death after three days of heavy rainfall, CNN Brazil reported.

In the city of Angra dos Reis, a 4-year-old girl and a teenager were killed and at least nine people were missing, the affiliate reported, citing civil defense and fire officials. Five people were rescued.

Rio de Janeiro state firefighters and civil defense authorities are deployed in the affected cities to help rescue people. The Civil Defense does not have an estimate on how many people are missing so far.

Brazil’s Interior Development Ministry said that Colonel Alexandre Lucas, the National Secretary for Civil Defense and Protection, is traveling to the regions most affected areas on Saturday.

British Columbia experienced devastating landslides and flooding last fall after torrential rain fell on regions scarred by wildfires, a nd more of these events are likely coming soon . A study published Friday in Science Advances found that under a high- emissions scenario—in a world where we do nothing to stop current levels of emissions—the frequency of back-to-back wildfires and rainfall events would increase seven times by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest and become twice as likely in California. The combo of fire and rain sets the stage for landslides , which can sweep away homes in an instant.

“We know those things are happening anyway, so let’s think about how likely it is within a single year both of them would happen—a fire, and then a rainstorm afterwards,” Samantha Stevenson, an assistant professor of environmental science at University of California, Santa Barbara and a coauthor of the study, told Earther. “We care about that because that has a much bigger impact than either of those things just happening individually.”

Both wildfires and heavy rainfall can be devastating on their own, but when rain falls on areas that haven’t fully recovered from fire, the effects can be catastrophic. Wildfires burn off a crucial layer of vegetation that helps to capture some of the water during rainfall, slowing down the water on its way into the soil. When heavy rains fall on areas scarred by wildfires, that barrier doesn’t exist, making debris flows (the more scientifically appropriate name for “mud slides,” since a lot of stuff besides mud can get caught up in the currents) much more likely. Fires also change the chemical composition of the soil itself, causing runoff to increase and upping the likelihood of severe erosion in certain areas.

T he study, which uses climate modeling to run different scenarios, examines the chance that wildfires and rainfall will coexist in a certain time period. “If you have two sets of dice, and one is for fire weather, and one is for rain, you could roll those independently, and some of the time you’d come up with, say, a six, and you’d get extreme fire or extreme rainfall,” Stevenson said. “That would happen by chance anyway. But what climate change is doing is loading those dice, so you’re more likely to get those extreme values.”

The findings aren’t particularly surprising; t he IPCC report published last year clearly laid the links between climate change supercharging rainstorms as well as helping wildfires get bigger and more destructive. B ut they’re extremely worrisome, given how devastating extreme rainfall can be to areas that have recently burned. Folks in the Pacific Northwest got a taste of what this future could look like last fall, when an atmospheric river dumped a torrent of rain on parts of British Columbia that had suffered through wildfires that summer. Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from towns and cities in the region, while at one point every major highway out of Vancouver was closed. Officials had to rescue nearly 300 people, including dozens of children, off a highway after they became trapped overnight by water, rocks, and mud.

Importantly, the study’s findings operate under a “business as usual” emissions scenario— projections that do not take into account any sort of climate action whatsoever and which are (hopefully) an overshoot of what actually will happen at the end of the century as the world tries to take decisive climate action now. However, even if the doomsday numbers the report projects are an overshoot, climate change has already upped the risk of wildfires and rainfall occurring in tandem.

Why has the Springfield water intake remained in the same inappropriate location for the last few years? 

Why are we as a community left drinking from a tanker and showering on the main highway while you oppose the exact process you have previously claimed is our only hope to getting the water sorted.

It's abundantly clear that beyond flying a helicopter up the river and drilling A hole the council has done nothing but abandon a community with completely inappropriate water services.

I came into the council the other week and was ridiculed by one of your councilors, bragging about their nice warm showers and telling me to stuff off back to Springfield and talk to the Springfield committee as you don't want to hear from us. 🙉 🙈 🙊

If any member of the council or water team took the time to walk up the river you'd see pretty quickly the issues do not flow from the landslides but flow out of the property opposite the water intake, a pig farm.

The river condition changes dramatically in the last km from the kowai bridge to the water intake yet apparently 'tHeRe's nO cLeAn WatEr' here, whose fault is that? Do you as a council not have a responsibility to ensure that activities in the region are not destroying the environment?

Yours sincerely",this mornings letter to selwyn district council mayor. I want it to be publicly known that as a council they have abandoned a whole community : newzealand,[],None,,"Good morning Sam

I've had the pleasure of reading an article this morning in the Malvern news where the council and you strongly oppose the three waters reform and claim to be delivering better water services than the government could.

Why has the Springfield water intake remained in the same inappropriate location for the last few years?

Why are we as a community left drinking from a tanker and showering on the main highway while you oppose the exact process you have previously claimed is our only hope to getting the water sorted.

It's abundantly clear that beyond flying a helicopter up the river and drilling A hole the council has done nothing but abandon a community with completely inappropriate water services.

I came into the council the other week and was ridiculed by one of your councilors, bragging about their nice warm showers and telling me to stuff off back to Springfield and talk to the Springfield committee as you don't want to hear from us. 🙉 🙈 🙊

If any member of the council or water team took the time to walk up the river you'd see pretty quickly the issues do not flow from the landslides but flow out of the property opposite the water intake, a pig farm.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Landslides are an act of nature that cost a lot of money to repair. Unfortunately, more and more keep popping up across the City of Pittsburgh.

KDKA Investigator Meghan Schiller wanted to find out how many landslides are on the city's list for monitoring and if the list is growing faster than in years past.

Only on KDKA: we took concerned residents' questions straight to Eric Setzler, the City of Pittsburgh's lead engineer.

KDKA first reported on the El Paso Street slide in Morningside on Feb. 16, but its appearance has deteriorated in the past month and a half. Setzler tells KDKA it's up next for repairs.

We interviewed concerned neighbors along El Paso Street in Morningside who tell KDKA that the mailman and delivery trucks are struggling to maneuver the narrowing roadway.

""It stopped at the bottom of my deck and the deck tipped over,"" said neighbor Collen Crnkovich.

We highlighted the disappearing Bon Air backyards along Drycove Street and talked to neighbors who fear the city will condemn their homes as their legal bills pile up.

""I have no place to go during the wintertime, during the pandemic,"" said neighbor Mary Kaye-Kienke.

State Rep. Emily Kinkead is pushing for funding to help homeowners like Kaye-Kienke stuck with high bills to repair landslides on their properties. She previously proposed House Bill 1054, hoping to create a way to help these homeowners since no home insurance will cover the cost.

""We don't have anything, like nothing exists to help people recover,"" said Kinkead.

Jersey barriers recently popped up on Andover Terrace in North Oakland. Neighbors say the street is shifting and pulling away from the sidewalk.

""I hope they're gonna fix it after all,"" said neighbor Della Pennywell.

It's a safety issue with no quick fix.

""Whoever owns the land that slides is responsible for fixing the landslide,"" said Setzler.

He admits it's not something in the budget for most homeowners.

""I mean it's hard enough for the city to have enough resources to fix these landslides, how can you expect the typical homeowner?"" he said.

But if the slide involves city property, like a street, stairs or ""right of way,"" it's his department's responsibility. He's tracking more than 100 slides right now.

""Probably in the range of 120 landslides that we're aware of and not all of those necessarily require any action,"" said Setzler. ""We have 75 that we're monitoring or keeping an eye on.""

It's expensive to do the research, complete a design and initiate the fix. Setzler tells KDKA the city's spending about $5 million each year to fix the slides.

""And honestly that's probably not enough,"" he said.

But he said it's a balancing act. The city's also paying to fix sidewalks, stairs and bridges.

Setzler tells KDKA that the residents of El Paso Street will see work begin shortly.

""It's very close to the end of the design process and we'll be putting it up to bid for construction, but that was a pretty big landslide, and it took a while to get through the design process,"" he said.",Pittsburgh Tracking Over 100 Active Landslides,[],2022-04-04 00:00:00,,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Landslides are an act of nature that cost a lot of money to repair.

The bodies of a British father and son have been recovered from the Blue Mountains, after they were killed in a “freak” landslide.

Police said the bodies of a nine-year-old boy and his 49-year-old father were recovered near Wentworth Pass at around 9.30am on Tuesday.

Five members of the same family were caught in the landslide on Monday while on holiday in Australia from the UK.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched out and taken to hospital on Monday afternoon with significant head and abdominal injuries.

Police say they have undergone surgery and remain in critical conditions.

A fifth member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was treated for shock after the landslip on a walking track, which was reported to emergency services about 1.40pm on Monday.

The Wentworth Pass track is a steep and difficult 5km loop, that encompasses waterfalls and valley views and can take up to five hours to complete.

A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said the track had been inspected in the days before the incident.

“The site is currently closed and a comprehensive review will be undertaken,” they said.

“The walking track where this incident occurred was inspected in the days before the rockslide as part of a routine track assessment program.

“NPWS has a world class program in place to assess geotechnical risks and maintain the safety of walking tracks and other infrastructure to the greatest extent practicable. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks such as rockslides, which can occasionally occur around the state.

“All of us at NPWS extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and those affected.”

NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Stewart Clarke told Sunrise earlier on Tuesday that all indications were that it was a “freak accident.”

“Everything we can glean from the notes during the calls [indicates] that certainly it was a freak accident.

“What was concerning more so after the fact was the concern that there were still noises being heard after the initial impact, which poses a significant risk to the patients as well as our people being sent in.”

Clarke added that a multi-agency rescue effort was launched on Monday afternoon to rescue the family, which included NSW police, Fire and Rescue NSW and NSW SES.

“These people who work tirelessly for us are the best in what they do,” Clarke said.

“They are highly trained and highly skilled but that doesn’t negate the intense risk assessments that were carried out at the time to ensure they were able to use these skills safely to access the patients to deliver some high level clinical care.”

NSW police Det Acting Supt John Nelson said: “Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they’ve been bushwalking. It’s quite a tragic scene.”

He described the 15-year-old as being “extremely distressed”.

“Both patients have significant head and abdominal injuries requiring sedation and intubation prior to them being extricated via winch,” Clarke told reporters on Monday.



The landslip had occurred in an “extremely dangerous, extremely unstable environment”, Clarke said, describing the situation as heartbreaking.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event,” Clarke said.



He described the rescue operation as “complex and delicate”, with crews working hard to access patients in rugged bushland and on unstable ground.

Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill told the Guardian the local community was heartbroken by the tragedy.

“Whether resident here or not, those who come to our beautiful Blue Mountains are taken into our hearts, and moments like this cause pain and grief to our entire community.”

“This was the holiday of a lifetime for a family that came from overseas, and has ended in unspeakable tragedy, and our whole community feels this.”

While the incident did not occur on council jurisdiction, Greenhill said the Blue Mountains City Council was working with National Parks and Wildlife Service in assessing walking tracks in the area.

Significant rain is predicted later this week. “As a result, Blue Mountains national park will be closed, except for Evans and Govetts Leap lookouts, from 9am” on Wednesday, the NPWS said in a statement on Tuesday.

Greg Tannos runs Find My Australia, a sports and recreation blog, and walked the Wentworth Pass track two days before the tragic landslip, saying he didn’t see anything dangerous.

“I actually thought the trail was quite OK when we walked it. These more off the grid tracks are a little less maintained, but that’s normal, most people won’t go that far down.

“I honestly didn’t think the trail looked damaged, and it didn’t seem to be overly soggy or wet down there.”

Tannos said he was shocked to hear of a landslide on the track calling it “just a terrible tragedy”.

“We passed over a small slide, but it looked like it had been there for a few months, there was nothing dangerous. There was nothing that gave me an indication something like this would happen.

**The city crawled up the mountain.** Stone keeps and half-fallen towers reached up to greet them. From here, Agraneia could see a glimpse into a garden square, which was now nothing more than dirt and tall sprays of grass.

She lost count of the cracked domes and collapsing towers, but even at a glance it was obvious: whatever this place had been, it must’ve been huge. Easily larger than Cyre, though she saw no railways nor highways for carts and drudges. 

Millions must’ve lived here once, and in the cities that dotted the plains out toward the horizon. 

“Old home,” the lassertane called this city. And they pointed out across all the fields, at the scattered remains of walled settlements, and named them all “Old home.” 

“We lived here,” the small lassertane said. Yarsi, or whatever her name was. Agra still wasn’t in the habit of remembering such things, and she was only starting to catch the godling’s name. 

“Long time before I was born, this was home. Before father was born, too.”

“What happened?” the godling asked. 

“Sen,” the Bloodchief growled as he walked past them. 

And Yarsi nodded her small, forest-green head. “Sen left us, went to sleep and never woke up. Demons came. Kill all people. Burn and break all buildings. All dead.” 

“Not us,” the Bloodchief said, and patted his daughter protectively on the head. “We find better place to live.” 

He nodded up ahead at the city of ruined castles. 

But all Agraneia saw were the shadows, and the shapes of those three huge, heavy ships floating above the city. 

They looked like heads, or bulbous metal pots, or something in between. Hundred of stories tall, every surface that faced down glowed with a blue light. Repulsors, the godling had called them.

Hundreds of long, flexible “tongues” stuck out of each Head, and each tongue was draped like string into the enormous pipes that jutted up from the city ruins. 

“You want us to go closer to those?” Eolh asked, dubiously. He was wrapped in a fur-lined coat, but it didn’t quite cover him and he was shivering still. 

The Bloodchief said, “Stay quiet. Not touch anything. No sound. Not even from feet.”

They set off down the mountainside, a single-file line picking their way slowly down the steps. Agra walked behind Eolh, and watched him shaking with every step. It seemed the jungle-dwelling corvani wasn’t used to anything less than his balmy planet, but he refused to complain. 

Agra peeled off her outer layer, and made him stop. He started to protest, but the moment she put it on him, he sighed into the warm coat. 

“Thanks,” he said, still chattering. “Isn’t this great?” Aren’t you guh...glad you left that prison s-s-cell?”

“Mhmm,” she said.

“It’s a j-joke, Ag.” 

Agraneia followed him for one reason: because Eolh was following a god, and following a god was a mission of death. They should not have survived the mists. Nor anything thereafter. 

Somehow, though, they were still alive.

But now, as she watched this godling, she couldn’t help but feel like something was still missing. Perhaps they had only been lucky so far.

That’s what the faces said, anyway. The ones that laughed at her. Or spit at her. 

Faces of people she had killed. Or people she had seen get killed. Or people she didn’t know at all, but who still cursed her name and watched her with those dead eyes. In the rocks, in the grasses, in the castle walls, they watched her from everywhere she went. 

*You can never be forgiven.*

Of course, they were right. And this did not bother her as much as it used to. 

So, their accusations transformed.

*You can never change. You loved it. You love nothing more.*

She didn’t want to listen, because she feared it was true. They had gotten worse, since they passed the thread of light. Almost as bad as when she was in the templelands…

*Stop,* she told them. And she told them again, *it cannot be undone.* 

And they laughed, and it sounded like rocks, skittering down the mountainside. 

Agraneia’s foot kicked a stone, and it skidded over the edge. The lassertane hissed a warning, and everyone dropped to their stomachs. 

The rock smacked and cracked against the mountain, bringing slides of pebbles with it, rattling and shushing down to the castles below. 

They waited. All of them, not moving, not saying anything. Even the godling was quiet, as stone clapped into the frost-dusted ruins.

Tendrils of dust rose into the air. 

The Heads hovered ponderously, a million tiny lights quietly blinking, their hundred tongues wavering slightly in the air.

But nothing else.

The Bloodchief moved first. Taking a few cautious steps down the trail. And when still nothing happened, he hissed quietly for the others to follow. Everyone took more care than before, especially Agraneia. The faces could laugh all they wanted, she was focused on the steep steps and cracked shelves of stone. 

Poire’s armor seemed to learn the ground as he walked, and tendrils of it stretched off his skin, grabbing onto this boulder or that ledge, fastening him lest he should fall. 

Agraneia could only imagine the usefulness of such an armor on someone who knew how to fight. How powerful a killer they would be. Could it stop projectiles? What about old tech? She tried to think of something in the Emperor’s arsenal that might compete with such a gift as sentient armor. 

And without meaning too, she started thinking of herself in that armor. Running through trees and mud. Running, with no one but enemies around her. How she would throw out her arms and send threads of silvery metal to pierce their skulls before they could even understand what had come at them. 

She knew it was wrong. But she couldn’t feel *how*. And it angered her, because something hurt, something was wrong, but she didn’t know what and-

*Stop.*

Her feet stopped. Poire almost bumped into her. Eolh turned around. 

“Ags?” he looked at her with an alien’s concern, still bundled tight in the coat she had given him. Her own scales were starting to stiffen in the bitter cold, and not even the sunlight could warm her bones. But the frozen numbness was better than what had been there before.

“Nothing,” she grumbled back and was about to keep moving, when she felt a cold hand on her shoulder, feathers covered in ice. 

“The faces?” he asked.

She nodded grimly.

“You can’t undo what’s been done. Can’t bring anyone back.”

“Mmm,” she agreed. But saying a thing did not make it any less painful.

“We’re looking for something better,” Eolh said. “Both of us.” 

*A machine. That’s all I’ll ever be.* 

But Eolh was shaking her, “And don’t you dare tell me you don’t deserve it. Yes, you do. It’s yours, if you look for it.”

They gathered at the top of a landslide, where the mountain met the city. The Bloodchief slid down first, and crept into the city. His ice-covered claws crunched slightly in the patches of snow, but held steady on the ice. Frozen blades of grass cracked in his steps.

He motioned for the rest to follow, and they did, each one sliding down exactly as he had done. 

Many of the buildings were nestled up against the pipes, and the snow dripped down their sides. The pipes were hot to the touch, but not unbearably, and at times they would make a deep, sighing sound that almost sounded like a death gasp. Once, Agraneia thought she saw a cloud of gray mist rising from its top until one of the Heads floated closer and dropped another tongue into its depths. 

Tumbled masonry filled the paths, ancient stone walls and roofless buildings huddled against each other, competing for height. All of them were half-destroyed, though Agraneia could see no sign of battle here. Whatever had happened here, happened a long time ago. Collapsed bridges made walls that blocked the streets. They made their way through dark manor houses, crumbling temples, buildings that might’ve been town halls or almshouses and multi-storied homes, so narrow that each floor was its own room.  

One temple had a whole copse of trees growing inside it, tearing the foundations down with their roots. Gorse grew in every garden, and ivies as red as blood crawled up the ruined keeps, especially near the pipes.

And over it all, the three Heads cast shadows like black clouds. Down here, she could see all the metal spikes and blinking lights and layers of shelled armor and mechanized infrastructure, idly rotating. Cranes and bar-arms, tipped with flashing lights, jutted out from hundreds of decks, and she thought she counted more than one weapons bay, where some enormous piece of gunnery might yet protrude.

The scale of it was difficult to comprehend, like looking at a mountain upside down. The harder she stared, the further away it appeared. 

Even the Exonerators, the Empire’s planet-class warships, looked fragile compared to these hulking behemoths, despite those feeble tubes feeding into the city, drinking from whatever heat source they could find in those pipes.

Each one could’ve been the size of a small town. Simply hanging there, as if they weighed nothing at all. How vast they were. How small she was.

*How many lassertane had* this *machine killed?* 

*Did it feel anything when they died?*

The heads, too, offgassed their steam, and a gentle twinkling precipitation drifted down to them, like near-frozen mist. 

Nobody spoke. 

The lassertane’s path through the ruins led them into the shadows, and through the broken gapways of the old buildings. They seemed to want to walk *between* the heads, but not directly under them. And Agraneia couldn’t argue with that. Even the godling seemed wary, like he had no idea what these things were. 

They moved slowly, careful not to make a sound.

A single word froze the whole troop: “Swarm.” 

The speaker pointed at the sky. Far across the horizon, a flock of shapes grew black. They looked like they were flapping, at first. Or bobbing up and down, as a hundred specks became a thousand, became ten thousand. 

They grabbed at Eolh. They grabbed at Agraneia, and she almost lost herself, before straining against her instinct. They gathered around Poire, not touching him, but urging him forward. 

“Go.” They said. “*Run quick.*” 

And then, they were all running. Claws scraped and boots clapped on the ancient stone streets. They knocked bricks and kicked rocks as they skittered around corners and dove into broken windows and doorways.

Agraneia heard the rattling first. A symphony of shrieking, scraping metal, as the drones flooded the skies. Thousand of metal bodies, with mechanical tentacles trailing behind them like ocean rays with too many tails. They jerked and rattled as they flew, their clattering hulls knocking against each other in the race to rise up to the Heads.

In anticipation of their arrival, the Heads let out a long, low tone that echoed over the rooftops, loud enough to dislodge snow, which crashed down and filled the streets with white clouds. Enormous racks rattled out from the Heads, and the drones attached themselves by the hundreds to hang from the newly-extended perches. 

But soon, there were more drones than the Heads could handle, and these began to alight on the city, finding perches on the broken stonework. Landing in the rookeries and the high windows. Covered with rust and frost, some with broken bodies, others trailing dead tentacles behind them. She couldn’t help but notice how slow some of them were, how dangerously close to the roofs they flew, as if they might drop out of the sky at any moment.

Still. Each drone was as large as a Fang, and Agraneia had no doubts about their ability to destroy.

And then, one drone did fall. It smashed into the street, just as Agraneia was crossing. Something inside the machine whined and went quiet and all its segmented tentacles went limp. Laying there like the carcass of a recently airborne whale.

And then, the drone whined again as it turned itself back on, and its tentacles rose in synchrony, pushing the body of the drone up.

Agraneia threw herself into the nearest building, where Eolh helped her inside. 

The troop was divided. Agraneia and Eolh with half, and Poire with the others. 

The lassertane tried to usher Agra deeper into the building, to some hidden underground tunnel they had here. But the Bloodchief was still standing in the doorway. His eyes were fixed across the street.

At first, Agraneia could only see Poire and the drone. The drone’s had sensors on its body, and most of them were irising open and closed, as if they were trying to turn back on. Lights flashed weakly across its sleek hull. 

It turned its body up, watching the shapes of other drones, wheeling above the buildings, making the sunlight flicker. And then, it cast its eyes around the street. 

Its tentacles went rigid, becoming six insect-like legs that let it creep away from Agraneia. 

It was aimed straight at something standing in the middle of the street. The Bloodchief’s daughter. 

Her scales were still painted white, but they had gone as gray as the castles, and it took Agraneia a moment to actually see her. The drone was having an even harder time. As if she was nothing more than a statue, slightly out of place.

Curiously, its spear-tipped legs clacked against the stones. Circling around her. 

Yarsi didn’t move at all. 

Beyond, Agraneia could just make out the black feathers of Eolh, shifting in a doorway. Cut off. 

“Bloodchief,” one of the lassertane said, and before they could speak, the Bloodchief whirled on the voice. “My *daughter*,” he growled. 

“No. She is lost.”

The drone’s hulking form towered over her. It lowered itself down, its sensors irising wildly as it tried to see her true shape.

“No!”

Twin wings of liquid metal flew out, and wrapped around the young lassertane. Poire threw himself against her and shielded her with his metal body. 

A flurry of feathers exploded in the doorway, as Eolh launched himself out. He smacked into the drone, and he was a fool if he thought he could do anything alone.

But Agraneia’s hands thought faster than she did. Her knives were out, and she was running. A growl at her side told her the Bloodchief was there, too, his spear clutched in both hands.

Together, they jabbed up at the drone’s underbelly. Barely denting it, but trying again and again as its tentacled legs whipped out to meet them. One metal tentacle swiped the Bloodchief, smacking him with such force that he went sprawling across the street and slumped against the stones. 

The drone’s single, lightning-fast kick had brought it close and low to Agraneia. She drove both of her knives into its belly, grunting with the strike and throwing her whole body into it. Feeling every muscle pushing, as the blades punched through a patch of thin, rusted metal, burying the blades up to the hilts. She rattled her knives, making three slices. Just like they had taught, back in the academy. One down, one out, one back up. She felt the cracking of fragile parts, felt the tug and snap of wires, as her knives cut the innards of the drone from inside its own hull. 

The oversized blades came out clean. She half expected them to be covered with blood. But machines did not bleed. Nor did they have faces.

*Then what were these?* A dozen of them, standing around her. Hissing and shouting and stabbing with their spears. A tentacle reached down to grab at her. At the same time, she heard a triumphant squawk from above as something ripped loose. 

The drone sagged, its long, jointed limbs scraping against the stones as it collapsed to the ground. Agraneia barely had time to move out of the way. 

Tumbled, rolled, and turned her blades on the others. Scaled faces, and black tongues flicking at the cold air. She was surrounded, but she was armed and ready. 

A voice called her name. Too quiet to hear over the pounding of her heart and the urge to kill burning in her blood. “Agra!” Eolh’s beak mouthed, but she could not hear him. 

Agra growled. And he approached, putting his hands up to calm her.

“Our side,” he said. “These are on our side. Sort of.”

Agra gritted her teeth. This was wrong. They had spears and scales and black tongues in their black mouths and she knew the smell of their blood, because she had cut so many of them open. 

The lassertane were gathered around their Bloodchief now, and Yarsi was directing them to carry him inside. Their eyes caught on her, but none of them attacked.

*Agra's arms burned with battle fury, her hands clenched around her knives. She should be killing them. She should not be killing them.*

*Confused. And angry at being confused.*

*A soldier who thinks is a soldier who dies, she thought.*

*Kill them. Stop standing there and-*

""Agra,"" Eolh croaked. 

And just that one word seemed to haul her up from some deep, black lake. Opened her ears. Opened her eyes. 

The grip on her blades softened.

An ear-shattering *blaaat* rang out over the rooftops. Two more answered its call. Agraneia looked up, to see the Heads lifting from the city. Withdrawing all their thousands of tongues.

And all those drones that were roosting so quietly, dropped from their perches to whirl in a maelstrom that blacked out the sky. They landed on the castle towers and broken walls and roofs, crawling down the stonework and into the streets.

*Don’t think.*

Eolh was holding her arm, holding her back. She almost threw him off. Almost threw her blade into his black-feathered neck...

A sting of realization bit into her scales. Made her fingers go weak. *When did I become... this?*

Her legs went weak. Her knees threatened to stop working.

“Come on, soldier,” he crowed, “This is a stupid place to die.”

Begrudgingly, she let him pull her into the building. Into the darkness, and away from all that rattling metal.

“They all are,” she agreed.

The city crawled up the mountain. Stone keeps and half-fallen towers reached up to greet them. From here, Agraneia could see a glimpse into a garden square, which was now nothing more than dirt and tall sprays of grass.

She lost count of the cracked domes and collapsing towers, but even at a glance it was obvious: whatever this place had been, it must’ve been huge. Easily larger than Cyre, though she saw no railways nor highways for carts and drudges.

Millions must’ve lived here once, and in the cities that dotted the plains out toward the horizon.

“Old home,” the lassertane called this city. And they pointed out across all the fields, at the scattered remains of walled settlements, and named them all “Old home.”

“We lived here,” the small lassertane said. Yarsi, or whatever her name was. Agra still wasn’t in the habit of remembering such things, and she was only starting to catch the godling’s name.

“Long time before I was born, this was home. Before father was born, too.”

“What happened?” the godling asked.

“Sen,” the Bloodchief growled as he walked past them.

And Yarsi nodded her small, forest-green head. “Sen left us, went to sleep and never woke up. Demons came. Kill all people. Burn and break all buildings. All dead.”

“Not us,” the Bloodchief said, and patted his daughter protectively on the head. “We find better place to live.”

He nodded up ahead at the city of ruined castles.

But all Agraneia saw were the shadows, and the shapes of those three huge, heavy ships floating above the city.

They looked like heads, or bulbous metal pots, or something in between. Hundred of stories tall, every surface that faced down glowed with a blue light. Repulsors, the godling had called them.

Hundreds of long, flexible “tongues” stuck out of each Head, and each tongue was draped like string into the enormous pipes that jutted up from the city ruins.

“You want us to go closer to those?” Eolh asked, dubiously. He was wrapped in a fur-lined coat, but it didn’t quite cover him and he was shivering still.

The Bloodchief said, “Stay quiet. Not touch anything. No sound. Not even from feet.”

They set off down the mountainside, a single-file line picking their way slowly down the steps. Agra walked behind Eolh, and watched him shaking with every step. It seemed the jungle-dwelling corvani wasn’t used to anything less than his balmy planet, but he refused to complain.

Agra peeled off her outer layer, and made him stop. He started to protest, but the moment she put it on him, he sighed into the warm coat.

“Thanks,” he said, still chattering. “Isn’t this great?” Aren’t you guh...glad you left that prison s-s-cell?”

“Mhmm,” she said.

“It’s a j-joke, Ag.”

Agraneia followed him for one reason: because Eolh was following a god, and following a god was a mission of death. They should not have survived the mists. Nor anything thereafter.

Somehow, though, they were still alive.

But now, as she watched this godling, she couldn’t help but feel like something was still missing. Perhaps they had only been lucky so far.

That’s what the faces said, anyway. The ones that laughed at her. Or spit at her.

Faces of people she had killed. Or people she had seen get killed. Or people she didn’t know at all, but who still cursed her name and watched her with those dead eyes. In the rocks, in the grasses, in the castle walls, they watched her from everywhere she went.

You can never be forgiven.

Of course, they were right. And this did not bother her as much as it used to.

So, their accusations transformed.

You can never change. You loved it. You love nothing more.

She didn’t want to listen, because she feared it was true. They had gotten worse, since they passed the thread of light. Almost as bad as when she was in the templelands…

Stop, she told them. And she told them again, it cannot be undone.

And they laughed, and it sounded like rocks, skittering down the mountainside.

Agraneia’s foot kicked a stone, and it skidded over the edge. The lassertane hissed a warning, and everyone dropped to their stomachs.

The rock smacked and cracked against the mountain, bringing slides of pebbles with it, rattling and shushing down to the castles below.

Stop.

Her feet stopped. Poire almost bumped into her. Eolh turned around.

“Ags?” he looked at her with an alien’s concern, still bundled tight in the coat she had given him. Her own scales were starting to stiffen in the bitter cold, and not even the sunlight could warm her bones. But the frozen numbness was better than what had been there before.

“Nothing,” she grumbled back and was about to keep moving, when she felt a cold hand on her shoulder, feathers covered in ice.

“The faces?” he asked.

She nodded grimly.

“You can’t undo what’s been done. Can’t bring anyone back.”

“Mmm,” she agreed. But saying a thing did not make it any less painful.

“We’re looking for something better,” Eolh said. “Both of us.”

A machine. That’s all I’ll ever be.

But Eolh was shaking her, “And don’t you dare tell me you don’t deserve it. Yes, you do. It’s yours, if you look for it.”

They gathered at the top of a landslide, where the mountain met the city. The Bloodchief slid down first, and crept into the city. His ice-covered claws crunched slightly in the patches of snow, but held steady on the ice. Frozen blades of grass cracked in his steps.

He motioned for the rest to follow, and they did, each one sliding down exactly as he had done.

Many of the buildings were nestled up against the pipes, and the snow dripped down their sides. The pipes were hot to the touch, but not unbearably, and at times they would make a deep, sighing sound that almost sounded like a death gasp. Once, Agraneia thought she saw a cloud of gray mist rising from its top until one of the Heads floated closer and dropped another tongue into its depths.

Tumbled masonry filled the paths, ancient stone walls and roofless buildings huddled against each other, competing for height.

Cranes and bar-arms, tipped with flashing lights, jutted out from hundreds of decks, and she thought she counted more than one weapons bay, where some enormous piece of gunnery might yet protrude.

The scale of it was difficult to comprehend, like looking at a mountain upside down. The harder she stared, the further away it appeared.

Even the Exonerators, the Empire’s planet-class warships, looked fragile compared to these hulking behemoths, despite those feeble tubes feeding into the city, drinking from whatever heat source they could find in those pipes.

Feeling every muscle pushing, as the blades punched through a patch of thin, rusted metal, burying the blades up to the hilts. She rattled her knives, making three slices. Just like they had taught, back in the academy. One down, one out, one back up. She felt the cracking of fragile parts, felt the tug and snap of wires, as her knives cut the innards of the drone from inside its own hull.

The oversized blades came out clean. She half expected them to be covered with blood. But machines did not bleed. Nor did they have faces.

Then what were these? A dozen of them, standing around her. Hissing and shouting and stabbing with their spears. A tentacle reached down to grab at her. At the same time, she heard a triumphant squawk from above as something ripped loose.

Agra's arms burned with battle fury, her hands clenched around her knives. She should be killing them. She should not be killing them.

Confused. And angry at being confused.

A soldier who thinks is a soldier who dies, she thought.

Kill them. Stop standing there and-

""Agra,"" Eolh croaked.

And just that one word seemed to haul her up from some deep, black lake. Opened her ears. Opened her eyes.

The grip on her blades softened.

An ear-shattering blaaat rang out over the rooftops. Two more answered its call. Agraneia looked up, to see the Heads lifting from the city. Withdrawing all their thousands of tongues.

And all those drones that were roosting so quietly, dropped from their perches to whirl in a maelstrom that blacked out the sky. They landed on the castle towers and broken walls and roofs, crawling down the stonework and into the streets.

Don’t think.

Eolh was holding her arm, holding her back. She almost threw him off. Almost threw her blade into his black-feathered neck...

A sting of realization bit into her scales. Made her fingers go weak. When did I become... this?

Her legs went weak. Her knees threatened to stop working.

“Come on, soldier,” he crowed, “This is a stupid place to die.”

Begrudgingly, she let him pull her into the building. Into the darkness, and away from all that rattling metal.

“They all are,” she agreed.

The city crawled up the mountain. Stone keeps and half-fallen towers reached up to greet them. From here, Agraneia could see a glimpse into a garden square, which was now nothing more than dirt and tall sprays of grass.

She lost count of the cracked domes and collapsing towers, but even at a glance it was obvious: whatever this place had been, it must’ve been huge. Easily larger than Cyre, though she saw no railways nor highways for carts and drudges.

Millions must’ve lived here once, and in the cities that dotted the plains out toward the horizon.

“Old home,” the lassertane called this city. And they pointed out across all the fields, at the scattered remains of walled settlements, and named them all “Old home.”

“We lived here,” the small lassertane said. Yarsi, or whatever her name was. Agra still wasn’t in the habit of remembering such things, and she was only starting to catch the godling’s name.

“Long time before I was born, this was home. Before father was born, too.”

“What happened?” the godling asked.

“Sen,” the Bloodchief growled as he walked past them.

And Yarsi nodded her small, forest-green head. “Sen left us, went to sleep and never woke up. Demons came. Kill all people. Burn and break all buildings. All dead.”

“Not us,” the Bloodchief said, and patted his daughter protectively on the head. “We find better place to live.”

He nodded up ahead at the city of ruined castles.

But all Agraneia saw were the shadows, and the shapes of those three huge, heavy ships floating above the city.

They looked like heads, or bulbous metal pots, or something in between. Hundred of stories tall, every surface that faced down glowed with a blue light. Repulsors, the godling had called them.

Hundreds of long, flexible “tongues” stuck out of each Head, and each tongue was draped like string into the enormous pipes that jutted up from the city ruins.

“You want us to go closer to those?” Eolh asked, dubiously. He was wrapped in a fur-lined coat, but it didn’t quite cover him and he was shivering still.

The Bloodchief said, “Stay quiet. Not touch anything. No sound. Not even from feet.”

They set off down the mountainside, a single-file line picking their way slowly down the steps. Agra walked behind Eolh, and watched him shaking with every step. It seemed the jungle-dwelling corvani wasn’t used to anything less than his balmy planet, but he refused to complain.

Agra peeled off her outer layer, and made him stop. He started to protest, but the moment she put it on him, he sighed into the warm coat.

“Thanks,” he said, still chattering. “Isn’t this great?” Aren’t you guh...glad you left that prison s-s-cell?”

“Mhmm,” she said.

“It’s a j-joke, Ag.”

Agraneia followed him for one reason: because Eolh was following a god, and following a god was a mission of death. They should not have survived the mists. Nor anything thereafter.

Somehow, though, they were still alive.

But now, as she watched this godling, she couldn’t help but feel like something was still missing. Perhaps they had only been lucky so far.

That’s what the faces said, anyway. The ones that laughed at her. Or spit at her.

Faces of people she had killed. Or people she had seen get killed. Or people she didn’t know at all, but who still cursed her name and watched her with those dead eyes. In the rocks, in the grasses, in the castle walls, they watched her from everywhere she went.

You can never be forgiven.

Of course, they were right. And this did not bother her as much as it used to.

So, their accusations transformed.

You can never change. You loved it. You love nothing more.

She didn’t want to listen, because she feared it was true. They had gotten worse, since they passed the thread of light. Almost as bad as when she was in the templelands…

Stop, she told them. And she told them again, it cannot be undone.

And they laughed, and it sounded like rocks, skittering down the mountainside.

Agraneia’s foot kicked a stone, and it skidded over the edge. The lassertane hissed a warning, and everyone dropped to their stomachs.

The rock smacked and cracked against the mountain, bringing slides of pebbles with it, rattling and shushing down to the castles below.

They waited. All of them, not moving, not saying anything. Even the godling was quiet, as stone clapped into the frost-dusted ruins.

Tendrils of dust rose into the air.

The Heads hovered ponderously, a million tiny lights quietly blinking, their hundred tongues wavering slightly in the air.

But nothing else.

The Bloodchief moved first. Taking a few cautious steps down the trail. And when still nothing happened, he hissed quietly for the others to follow. Everyone took more care than before, especially Agraneia. The faces could laugh all they wanted, she was focused on the steep steps and cracked shelves of stone.

Poire’s armor seemed to learn the ground as he walked, and tendrils of it stretched off his skin, grabbing onto this boulder or that ledge, fastening him lest he should fall.

Agraneia could only imagine the usefulness of such an armor on someone who knew how to fight. How powerful a killer they would be. Could it stop projectiles? What about old tech? She tried to think of something in the Emperor’s arsenal that might compete with such a gift as sentient armor.

And without meaning too, she started thinking of herself in that armor. Running through trees and mud. Running, with no one but enemies around her. How she would throw out her arms and send threads of silvery metal to pierce their skulls before they could even understand what had come at them.

She knew it was wrong. But she couldn’t feel how. And it angered her, because something hurt, something was wrong, but she didn’t know what and-

Stop.

Her feet stopped. Poire almost bumped into her. Eolh turned around.

“Ags?” he looked at her with an alien’s concern, still bundled tight in the coat she had given him. Her own scales were starting to stiffen in the bitter cold, and not even the sunlight could warm her bones. But the frozen numbness was better than what had been there before.

“Nothing,” she grumbled back and was about to keep moving, when she felt a cold hand on her shoulder, feathers covered in ice.

“The faces?” he asked.

She nodded grimly.

“You can’t undo what’s been done. Can’t bring anyone back.”

“Mmm,” she agreed. But saying a thing did not make it any less painful.

“We’re looking for something better,” Eolh said. “Both of us.”

A machine. That’s all I’ll ever be.

But Eolh was shaking her, “And don’t you dare tell me you don’t deserve it. Yes, you do. It’s yours, if you look for it.”

They gathered at the top of a landslide, where the mountain met the city. The Bloodchief slid down first, and crept into the city. His ice-covered claws crunched slightly in the patches of snow, but held steady on the ice. Frozen blades of grass cracked in his steps.

He motioned for the rest to follow, and they did, each one sliding down exactly as he had done.

Many of the buildings were nestled up against the pipes, and the snow dripped down their sides. The pipes were hot to the touch, but not unbearably, and at times they would make a deep, sighing sound that almost sounded like a death gasp. Once, Agraneia thought she saw a cloud of gray mist rising from its top until one of the Heads floated closer and dropped another tongue into its depths.

Tumbled masonry filled the paths, ancient stone walls and roofless buildings huddled against each other, competing for height. All of them were half-destroyed, though Agraneia could see no sign of battle here. Whatever had happened here, happened a long time ago. Collapsed bridges made walls that blocked the streets. They made their way through dark manor houses, crumbling temples, buildings that might’ve been town halls or almshouses and multi-storied homes, so narrow that each floor was its own room.

One temple had a whole copse of trees growing inside it, tearing the foundations down with their roots. Gorse grew in every garden, and ivies as red as blood crawled up the ruined keeps, especially near the pipes.

And over it all, the three Heads cast shadows like black clouds. Down here, she could see all the metal spikes and blinking lights and layers of shelled armor and mechanized infrastructure, idly rotating. Cranes and bar-arms, tipped with flashing lights, jutted out from hundreds of decks, and she thought she counted more than one weapons bay, where some enormous piece of gunnery might yet protrude.

The scale of it was difficult to comprehend, like looking at a mountain upside down. The harder she stared, the further away it appeared.

Even the Exonerators, the Empire’s planet-class warships, looked fragile compared to these hulking behemoths, despite those feeble tubes feeding into the city, drinking from whatever heat source they could find in those pipes.

Each one could’ve been the size of a small town. Simply hanging there, as if they weighed nothing at all. How vast they were. How small she was.

How many lassertane had this machine killed?

Did it feel anything when they died?

The heads, too, offgassed their steam, and a gentle twinkling precipitation drifted down to them, like near-frozen mist.

Nobody spoke.

The lassertane’s path through the ruins led them into the shadows, and through the broken gapways of the old buildings. They seemed to want to walk between the heads, but not directly under them. And Agraneia couldn’t argue with that. Even the godling seemed wary, like he had no idea what these things were.

They moved slowly, careful not to make a sound.

A single word froze the whole troop: “Swarm.”

The speaker pointed at the sky. Far across the horizon, a flock of shapes grew black. They looked like they were flapping, at first. Or bobbing up and down, as a hundred specks became a thousand, became ten thousand.

They grabbed at Eolh. They grabbed at Agraneia, and she almost lost herself, before straining against her instinct. They gathered around Poire, not touching him, but urging him forward.

“Go.” They said. “Run quick.”

And then, they were all running. Claws scraped and boots clapped on the ancient stone streets. They knocked bricks and kicked rocks as they skittered around corners and dove into broken windows and doorways.

Agraneia heard the rattling first. A symphony of shrieking, scraping metal, as the drones flooded the skies. Thousand of metal bodies, with mechanical tentacles trailing behind them like ocean rays with too many tails. They jerked and rattled as they flew, their clattering hulls knocking against each other in the race to rise up to the Heads.

In anticipation of their arrival, the Heads let out a long, low tone that echoed over the rooftops, loud enough to dislodge snow, which crashed down and filled the streets with white clouds. Enormous racks rattled out from the Heads, and the drones attached themselves by the hundreds to hang from the newly-extended perches.

But soon, there were more drones than the Heads could handle, and these began to alight on the city, finding perches on the broken stonework. Landing in the rookeries and the high windows. Covered with rust and frost, some with broken bodies, others trailing dead tentacles behind them. She couldn’t help but notice how slow some of them were, how dangerously close to the roofs they flew, as if they might drop out of the sky at any moment.

Still. Each drone was as large as a Fang, and Agraneia had no doubts about their ability to destroy.

And then, one drone did fall. It smashed into the street, just as Agraneia was crossing. Something inside the machine whined and went quiet and all its segmented tentacles went limp. Laying there like the carcass of a recently airborne whale.

And then, the drone whined again as it turned itself back on, and its tentacles rose in synchrony, pushing the body of the drone up.

Agraneia threw herself into the nearest building, where Eolh helped her inside.

The troop was divided. Agraneia and Eolh with half, and Poire with the others.

The lassertane tried to usher Agra deeper into the building, to some hidden underground tunnel they had here. But the Bloodchief was still standing in the doorway. His eyes were fixed across the street.

At first, Agraneia could only see Poire and the drone. The drone’s had sensors on its body, and most of them were irising open and closed, as if they were trying to turn back on. Lights flashed weakly across its sleek hull.

It turned its body up, watching the shapes of other drones, wheeling above the buildings, making the sunlight flicker. And then, it cast its eyes around the street.

Its tentacles went rigid, becoming six insect-like legs that let it creep away from Agraneia.

It was aimed straight at something standing in the middle of the street. The Bloodchief’s daughter.

Her scales were still painted white, but they had gone as gray as the castles, and it took Agraneia a moment to actually see her. The drone was having an even harder time. As if she was nothing more than a statue, slightly out of place.

Curiously, its spear-tipped legs clacked against the stones. Circling around her.

Yarsi didn’t move at all.

Beyond, Agraneia could just make out the black feathers of Eolh, shifting in a doorway. Cut off.

“Bloodchief,” one of the lassertane said, and before they could speak, the Bloodchief whirled on the voice. “My daughter,” he growled.

“No. She is lost.”

The drone’s hulking form towered over her. It lowered itself down, its sensors irising wildly as it tried to see her true shape.

“No!”

Twin wings of liquid metal flew out, and wrapped around the young lassertane. Poire threw himself against her and shielded her with his metal body.

A flurry of feathers exploded in the doorway, as Eolh launched himself out. He smacked into the drone, and he was a fool if he thought he could do anything alone.

But Agraneia’s hands thought faster than she did. Her knives were out, and she was running. A growl at her side told her the Bloodchief was there, too, his spear clutched in both hands.

Together, they jabbed up at the drone’s underbelly. Barely denting it, but trying again and again as its tentacled legs whipped out to meet them. One metal tentacle swiped the Bloodchief, smacking him with such force that he went sprawling across the street and slumped against the stones.

The drone’s single, lightning-fast kick had brought it close and low to Agraneia. She drove both of her knives into its belly, grunting with the strike and throwing her whole body into it. Feeling every muscle pushing, as the blades punched through a patch of thin, rusted metal, burying the blades up to the hilts. She rattled her knives, making three slices. Just like they had taught, back in the academy. One down, one out, one back up. She felt the cracking of fragile parts, felt the tug and snap of wires, as her knives cut the innards of the drone from inside its own hull.

The oversized blades came out clean. She half expected them to be covered with blood. But machines did not bleed. Nor did they have faces.

Then what were these? A dozen of them, standing around her. Hissing and shouting and stabbing with their spears. A tentacle reached down to grab at her. At the same time, she heard a triumphant squawk from above as something ripped loose.

The drone sagged, its long, jointed limbs scraping against the stones as it collapsed to the ground. Agraneia barely had time to move out of the way.

Tumbled, rolled, and turned her blades on the others. Scaled faces, and black tongues flicking at the cold air. She was surrounded, but she was armed and ready.

A voice called her name. Too quiet to hear over the pounding of her heart and the urge to kill burning in her blood. “Agra!” Eolh’s beak mouthed, but she could not hear him.

Agra growled. And he approached, putting his hands up to calm her.

“Our side,” he said. “These are on our side. Sort of.”

Agra gritted her teeth. This was wrong. They had spears and scales and black tongues in their black mouths and she knew the smell of their blood, because she had cut so many of them open.

The lassertane were gathered around their Bloodchief now, and Yarsi was directing them to carry him inside. Their eyes caught on her, but none of them attacked.

Agra's arms burned with battle fury, her hands clenched around her knives. She should be killing them. She should not be killing them.

Confused. And angry at being confused.

A soldier who thinks is a soldier who dies, she thought.

Kill them. Stop standing there and-

""Agra,"" Eolh croaked.

And just that one word seemed to haul her up from some deep, black lake. Opened her ears. Opened her eyes.

The grip on her blades softened.

An ear-shattering blaaat rang out over the rooftops. Two more answered its call. Agraneia looked up, to see the Heads lifting from the city. Withdrawing all their thousands of tongues.

And all those drones that were roosting so quietly, dropped from their perches to whirl in a maelstrom that blacked out the sky. They landed on the castle towers and broken walls and roofs, crawling down the stonework and into the streets.

Don’t think.

Eolh was holding her arm, holding her back. She almost threw him off. Almost threw her blade into his black-feathered neck...

A sting of realization bit into her scales. Made her fingers go weak. When did I become... this?

Her legs went weak. Her knees threatened to stop working.

“Come on, soldier,” he crowed, “This is a stupid place to die.”

Begrudgingly, she let him pull her into the building. Into the darkness, and away from all that rattling metal.

“They all are,” she agreed.

In 2020, seismologist Göran Ekström noticed a peculiar wiggle picked up on Nov. 28 by seismographs around the world. It emanated from a remote area in British Columbia’s steep, glaciated Central Coast Mountains, some 2,400 miles from Ekström’s office at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, in Palisades, N.Y.

“When I find something [that] looks a bit strange, I look at it more carefully,” said Ekström, who studies unusual seismic events. Conventional earthquakes usually begin with a big, high-frequency jolt, but this was not the case here. This was more of a low-frequency rumble that gradually accelerated before fading back—according to Ekström’s studies, the kind of signal produced by a big landslide. He emailed Marten Geertsema, a natural-hazards specialist with the BC provincial government. Seeing nothing in the news, Geertsema proceeded to scan recent satellite imagery of the area for signs of a disturbance, but couldn’t spot anything at first.

Around the same time, BC aviators heard about an unusual amount of wood floating in a fjord. They helicoptered in. Flying further up a river feeding the fjord, they saw countless mowed-down trees and a vast new wasteland of sand and gravel. Tracing up a side valley occupied by a stream called Elliot Creek, they found the source: the fresh scar of a gigantic landslide. It had hit a meltwater lake at the toe of the West Grenville Glacier and created a tsunami that devastated everything downstream. The scientists quickly connected the dots.

TACLOBAN CITY – Abuyog, Leyte is appealing for help as one of its coastal villages has been hit by a landslide triggered by massive flood brought by Tropical Depression ‘Agaton’ Tuesday afternoon (April 12).

Initial information from the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed that about 80 percent of Brgy. Pilar has been damaged.

Rescuers in Abuyog are calling for more boats to speed up the transport of rescued victims since most of the road are blockaded by big boulders and uprooted trees.

More medical volunteers are also badly needed to help the medical teams attend to the injured victims.

Getting immediate response from nearby rescue teams from Dulag, Mayorga, and Tanauan, the Abuyog rescuers were able to find more survivors, although they were yet to be accounted for as of this writing.

Abuyog, the largest town in Leyte in terms of land area, had been submerged in neck-deep flood last Sunday.

A landslide in the nearby village of Bahay also claimed two lives, and a 10-year-old male from Brgy. Tic-o.

These brought Agaton’s death toll to 40, with 36 coming from Baybay City, three from Abuyog, and one from Motiong, Samar.",Leyte village appeals for help after being hit by massive landslide; dozens injured,[],2022-04-12 00:00:00,,"TACLOBAN CITY – Abuyog, Leyte is appealing for help as one of its coastal villages has been hit by a landslide triggered by massive flood brought by Tropical Depression ‘Agaton’ Tuesday afternoon (April 12).

Recently, I have stumbled upon something very strange going on in our town. Nothing very exciting usually happens here. To give you a picture: the most interesting story last week was a kitten stuck in a tree. Yet I have a job to do and sometimes you have to really squeeze a story out of something. You really have to pay attention to the details when interviewing someone, you never know what threads you may unravel. Being starved of stories, my wife suggested I should do a story on her mountain climbing group, I was a bit surprised she had even joined one since she was never the outdoorsy type.

""Who are you and what have you done with my wife?"" I jokingly asked her.

She got all defensive and said that she has loved hiking and climbing all her life, which I found strange since we have never gone hiking together nor has she asked me to go with her. Before last week that is. She has been constantly hounding me to hike a mountain with her and she doesn't shut up about it. Not being an outdoorsy type myself, not to mention my fear of heights, I have resisted her invitations. I eventually agreed to interview her friend Becky from the climbing group as a compromise. She is of course expecting that Becky will get me interested in their mutual hobby. I don't see that happening, but anything for a story right? The next day I met Becky at a café.

""Hello Becky, nice to meet you!""

I shook her hand and noticed it was scratched and bruised with long painted fingernails.

""Nice to meet you too, David.""

""So how long have you been into climbing?""

""Pretty much all my life.""

I found this strange, you would expect a lifelong climber to have rough hands and short fingernails. She didn't seem like the climber type at all.

""Oh really? How are you able to climb with those long fingernails of yours?""

""Oh haha, I don't know really, I manage. I go climbing every day, it must be in my blood.""

""Must be. So where do you usually go climbing?""

""There's this really amazing mountain about 20 miles towards the coast, I mostly just go there with the group. You should really join us sometime! You won't regret it.""

""Erm, no thank you, I am basically allergic to heights. Can't even look out a window on a tall building without pissing myself.""

""Haha, well suit yourself, but seriously, this mountain is something else. Once you're up there the view is otherworldly! Sometimes I even see it in my dreams.""

""I'll take your word for it.""

We chatted with Becky for awhile longer, I kept trying to steer the conversation to something else, some other hobbies she might have, but somehow the topic always came back to the mountain. I was tired of hearing about it and figured I had enough for my story in the paper.

As I was writing my draft for the story that afternoon, I thought it would be nice to have some pictures of the mountain and perhaps even that 'otherworldly' view Becky kept going on about. I asked my wife if she had taken any pictures on her hikes and she said no.

""The view from the mountain must be witnessed yourself, a picture simply can't do it justice"" she told me.

Not satisfied with her answer, I decided I would ask around town tomorrow if anyone else had pictures of the mountain. The next morning I wake up with an ache in my foot and wonder where I had sprained it. Jen isn’t sleeping next to me, she must’ve gotten an early start. Not finding her anywhere in the house I’m about to call out to her when I find a note on the kitchen table:

“Went hiking – Love, Jen”

Oh well, there she goes again. Can’t have enough of that hiking. I head into town and ask around if anyone knows about a ‘mystical’ mountain around here. Nobody really knows what I’m talking about, until I get to Mrs. Hayward. She’s a sweet old lady who’s been around as long as I can remember, always getting into other peoples’ business, she sure likes her gossip and whatnot.

“Oh you mean the Crooked Mountain? Why yes, I’ve heard of it! There’s been a group of youngsters heading up there quite a lot recently. Even got meself curious to see the view. But me poor old legs wouldn’t be able to handle it, it seems they are aching more and more by the day! I would need someone to carry me, you wouldn’t be up for it, would you? Hahaa!”

She was joking of course, but I could sense a certain urgency in her voice. I left Mrs. Hayward to her dark deeds and continued on with my investigation. The streets seemed busier than usual, I’d never seen so many people walking around town before. I stopped a guy to ask him where he’s rushing to and he replied “Oh just stretching my legs!”. I’m starting to notice a pattern here. Why is everyone suddenly so obsessed with walking, and mountains?

I went to the police station to see if they know anything and found out something fairly disturbing. There’s been several reports of people waking up with broken legs. They can’t make heads nor tails of it. How does someone break their legs while sleeping, it makes no sense.

I call my wife. It rings once, it rings twice. She answers.

“Hey, honey what’s up?”

“Hey Jen, are you still hiking? There’s something we gotta talk about.”

“I’m heading back already, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing urgent, I’ll tell you when you get back”

She gets back from her hike and we talk about what I’ve found out talking to the townsfolk, but she just brushes it off:

“The people are becoming more active and healthier, what’s so wrong with that?”

“I don’t know, it just seems so sudden. What about the people who woke up with broken legs?”

“Oh I know those people, they fell during a landslide on one of our hiking trips, they’re just too doped up on painkillers to even remember.”

It did seem like a reasonable explanation, but something still irked me about all this. As a journalist, wouldn’t I have heard about something like that happening? After struggling awhile to fall asleep, that night I dreamt of the Crooked Mountain.

In the dream, me and Jen were hiking together up an overgrown path, it seemed to take forever to get up there and Jen kept making fun of me for being so out of shape.

“You knew you weren’t marrying a mountain man.” I told her.

When we started getting near the peak, Jen got very excited and ran far ahead of me.

“Hold on Jen! What’s the rush?”

“We’re almost there, it’s so close! I can’t wait to see it again!”

When I finally reached Jen, I look over the cliff at the horizon… and I was instantly stunned. What is this? It can’t be real. What lay before me was a landscape not of our world. There were pillars of light spanning throughout the landscape, epic waterfalls towering over glistening structures with rainbows consisting of impossible colors decorating them. I simply couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing, but it was all so beautiful. Was I in heaven? Or is this a dream? I didn’t realize how close to the edge I was standing and a rock came loose. I fell.

I woke up sweaty and panicked, but calmed down when I realized it had been a dream. My legs were hurting all over for some reason, it’s almost like I actually fell off a cliff. I turned over to wake up Jen and tell her about the dream, but she was gone. I looked for her in the house again but this time she hadn’t left a note. I try calling her on the phone. It rings once. It rings twice. It keeps ringing with no answer. Maybe she went hiking and doesn't have reception on the mountain? After a few hours I still couldn't reach her and I started to get worried. I called Becky and got no answer either. They must be hiking together. I have to drive to the mountain to see if she’s okay.

As I'm driving towards the coast, I can see something familiar in the distance. It’s the crooked peak that I’ve heard described to me countless times by now. I am both nervous and strangely excited about what I will find there. Good thing my legs have stopped aching, I might actually have to climb the mountain to look for Jen. I shudder at the thought.

I reach the base of the mountain and don’t see any sign of Jen. However, there is some abandoned climbing gear around, could still be useful for climbing, although I wouldn’t really know how to use it. There is a sign here that points towards the mountain wall saying “This way to Crooked Peak”, however it seems to be pointing at a flat, almost 90 degree wall. I start scanning it for climbable spots, but for the life of me I can't really find any way to get up. I've heard of free solo climbers who are able to climb such walls with no equipment, although they of course do it with climbing gear first and really hammer the correct path into their heads. I try shouting for Jen with no luck. That’s when I notice a broken fingernail on the wall. It belongs to Becky! They must’ve climbed up there.

I am lost in thought at how I'm going to climb this mountain and about to give up on the thought, when I hear a faint rumble. I perk my ears and it gets louder. Suddenly the ground starts shaking, more and more violently with every second. My phone starts blasting some kind of siren and I panickedly look at the screen:

TSUNAMI WARNING!!! GET TO HIGH GROUND IMMEDIATELY

Fuck. Fucking fuck. How the hell is there such a massive earthquake in this area to cause a tsunami?!

At first, I thought this can't possibly be real, but when I looked towards the coast my face went pale. The seawater was receding at a rapid pace, a surefire sign of an incoming tsunami. I look back at the mountain and realize I have no choice. I have to climb up to survive. I jump onto the wall and somehow I’m able to get a grip on the stones, although barely. I keep finding small cracks and crevices to put my hands and feet. I don't dare to even look down or towards the coast again. I don't want to see the giant wave coming towards me, I'd rather just keep climbing as fast as I can and accept my fate if I don't make it high enough. If I looked down, I would probably panic and make a mistake.

I keep climbing and climbing, it’s starting to become even enjoyable. Were they right about it all along? Could the view actually be as incredible as I dreamed?

My fingers are bleeding and hurting badly. I think, why is the tsunami not here yet? I muster up the courage to look behind me... and there is no tsunami. The coast looks as peaceful as it ever did. What the hell? Was the warning a dud? Was I imagining it? And then I looked down.

I realized I had climbed the wall up to a height of about 10 stories and my heart dropped to my stomach. I had no climbing gear and I was up at an insane height, barely hanging onto the wall. I suddenly couldn’t find anywhere to get a grip anymore to keep going up. It seems the only way is back down. I tried looking to see where I had put my feet before, but it was impossible, the wall seemed completely flat. Perhaps I can gently slide down, maybe the wall is slanted enough to keep a steady slide? I tried looking around some more to see if there really is no other possible way. I started to panic and my hands got sweaty. Then it happened, my worst fear in life. My right hand slipped and I started sliding down the wall. My mind went completely blank and all I could feel was the impending death as my body pulled away from the wall and I went into freefall. All the blood in my body rushed into my legs to brace for impact. Then for a glimpse, I saw it. I saw the unfathomable beauty and the pure bliss of the heavenly landscape of my dreams. The light almost blinding me. I could embrace it for just a moment before realizing something was wrong, it all seemed fake, an illusion. The blissful world started breaking down into pure black and shades of red, rainbows and lush forests being replaced with disturbing structures of flesh and bone. I could feel my humanity being sucked out of me into the grotesque hellscape. Then suddenly I landed on the ground, breaking most of the bones in my body and splattering blood around me. I lay there in agony, trying to move, but it was no use. My legs were shattered. My lower body was completely paralyzed.

Then I saw my wife, the mangled corpse of my wife. And Becky. And all the other hikers. They all had wide grins of pure bliss on their lifeless faces. And all I could think was: did I not climb high enough?",scarystories,"The people in my town have been having visions of a mountain, they claim the view from it is otherworldly",https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/u5qn8j/the_people_in_my_town_have_been_having_visions_of/,1650213073.0,landslide,"The people in my town have been having visions of a mountain, they claim the view from it is otherworldly : scarystories

The next morning I wake up with an ache in my foot and wonder where I had sprained it. Jen isn’t sleeping next to me, she must’ve gotten an early start. Not finding her anywhere in the house I’m about to call out to her when I find a note on the kitchen table:

“Went hiking – Love, Jen”

Oh well, there she goes again. Can’t have enough of that hiking. I head into town and ask around if anyone knows about a ‘mystical’ mountain around here. Nobody really knows what I’m talking about, until I get to Mrs. Hayward. She’s a sweet old lady who’s been around as long as I can remember, always getting into other peoples’ business, she sure likes her gossip and whatnot.

“Oh you mean the Crooked Mountain? Why yes, I’ve heard of it! There’s been a group of youngsters heading up there quite a lot recently. Even got meself curious to see the view. But me poor old legs wouldn’t be able to handle it, it seems they are aching more and more by the day! I would need someone to carry me, you wouldn’t be up for it, would you? Hahaa!”

She was joking of course, but I could sense a certain urgency in her voice. I left Mrs. Hayward to her dark deeds and continued on with my investigation. The streets seemed busier than usual, I’d never seen so many people walking around town before. I stopped a guy to ask him where he’s rushing to and he replied “Oh just stretching my legs!”. I’m starting to notice a pattern here. Why is everyone suddenly so obsessed with walking, and mountains?

I went to the police station to see if they know anything and found out something fairly disturbing. There’s been several reports of people waking up with broken legs. They can’t make heads nor tails of it. How does someone break their legs while sleeping, it makes no sense.

I call my wife. It rings once, it rings twice. She answers.

“Hey, honey what’s up?”

“Hey Jen, are you still hiking? There’s something we gotta talk about.”

“I’m heading back already, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing urgent, I’ll tell you when you get back”

She gets back from her hike and we talk about what I’ve found out talking to the townsfolk, but she just brushes it off:

“The people are becoming more active and healthier, what’s so wrong with that?”

“I don’t know, it just seems so sudden. What about the people who woke up with broken legs?”

“Oh I know those people, they fell during a landslide on one of our hiking trips, they’re just too doped up on painkillers to even remember.”

It did seem like a reasonable explanation, but something still irked me about all this. As a journalist, wouldn’t I have heard about something like that happening? After struggling awhile to fall asleep, that night I dreamt of the Crooked Mountain.

In the dream, me and Jen were hiking together up an overgrown path, it seemed to take forever to get up there and Jen kept making fun of me for being so out of shape.

“You knew you weren’t marrying a mountain man.” I told her.

When we started getting near the peak, Jen got very excited and ran far ahead of me.

“Hold on Jen! What’s the rush?”

“We’re almost there, it’s so close! I can’t wait to see it again!”

When I finally reached Jen, I look over the cliff at the horizon… and I was instantly stunned. What is this? It can’t be real. What lay before me was a landscape not of our world. There were pillars of light spanning throughout the landscape, epic waterfalls towering over glistening structures with rainbows consisting of impossible colors decorating them. I simply couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing, but it was all so beautiful. Was I in heaven? Or is this a dream? I didn’t realize how close to the edge I was standing and a rock came loose. I fell.

I woke up sweaty and panicked, but calmed down when I realized it had been a dream. My legs were hurting all over for some reason, it’s almost like I actually fell off a cliff. I turned over to wake up Jen and tell her about the dream, but she was gone. I looked for her in the house again but this time she hadn’t left a note. I try calling her on the phone. It rings once. It rings twice. It keeps ringing with no answer. Maybe she went hiking and doesn't have reception on the mountain? After a few hours I still couldn't reach her and I started to get worried. I called Becky and got no answer either. They must be hiking together. I have to drive to the mountain to see if she’s okay.

As I'm driving towards the coast, I can see something familiar in the distance. It’s the crooked peak that I’ve heard described to me countless times by now. I am both nervous and strangely excited about what I will find there. Good thing my legs have stopped aching, I might actually have to climb the mountain to look for Jen. I shudder at the thought.

I reach the base of the mountain and don’t see any sign of Jen. However, there is some abandoned climbing gear around, could still be useful for climbing, although I wouldn’t really know how to use it. There is a sign here that points towards the mountain wall saying “This way to Crooked Peak”, however it seems to be pointing at a flat, almost 90 degree wall. I start scanning it for climbable spots, but for the life of me I can't really find any way to get up. I've heard of free solo climbers who are able to climb such walls with no equipment, although they of course do it with climbing gear first and really hammer the correct path into their heads. I try shouting for Jen with no luck. That’s when I notice a broken fingernail on the wall. It belongs to Becky! They must’ve climbed up there.

I am lost in thought at how I'm going to climb this mountain and about to give up on the thought, when I hear a faint rumble. I perk my ears and it gets louder. Suddenly the ground starts shaking, more and more violently with every second. My phone starts blasting some kind of siren and I panickedly look at the screen:

TSUNAMI WARNING!!! GET TO HIGH GROUND IMMEDIATELY

Fuck. Fucking fuck. How the hell is there such a massive earthquake in this area to cause a tsunami?!

At first, I thought this can't possibly be real, but when I looked towards the coast my face went pale. The seawater was receding at a rapid pace, a surefire sign of an incoming tsunami. I look back at the mountain and realize I have no choice. I have to climb up to survive. I jump onto the wall and somehow I’m able to get a grip on the stones, although barely. I keep finding small cracks and crevices to put my hands and feet. I don't dare to even look down or towards the coast again. I don't want to see the giant wave coming towards me, I'd rather just keep climbing as fast as I can and accept my fate if I don't make it high enough. If I looked down, I would probably panic and make a mistake.

I keep climbing and climbing, it’s starting to become even enjoyable. Were they right about it all along? Could the view actually be as incredible as I dreamed?

My fingers are bleeding and hurting badly. I think, why is the tsunami not here yet? I muster up the courage to look behind me... and there is no tsunami. The coast looks as peaceful as it ever did. What the hell? Was the warning a dud? Was I imagining it? And then I looked down.

I realized I had climbed the wall up to a height of about 10 stories and my heart dropped to my stomach. I had no climbing gear and I was up at an insane height, barely hanging onto the wall. I suddenly couldn’t find anywhere to get a grip anymore to keep going up. It seems the only way is back down. I tried looking to see where I had put my feet before, but it was impossible, the wall seemed completely flat. Perhaps I can gently slide down, maybe the wall is slanted enough to keep a steady slide? I tried looking around some more to see if there really is no other possible way. I started to panic and my hands got sweaty. Then it happened, my worst fear in life. My right hand slipped and I started sliding down the wall. My mind went completely blank and all I could feel was the impending death as my body pulled away from the wall and I went into freefall. All the blood in my body rushed into my legs to brace for impact. Then for a glimpse, I saw it. I saw the unfathomable beauty and the pure bliss of the heavenly landscape of my dreams. The light almost blinding me. I could embrace it for just a moment before realizing something was wrong, it all seemed fake, an illusion. The blissful world started breaking down into pure black and shades of red, rainbows and lush forests being replaced with disturbing structures of flesh and bone. I could feel my humanity being sucked out of me into the grotesque hellscape. Then suddenly I landed on the ground, breaking most of the bones in my body and splattering blood around me. I lay there in agony, trying to move, but it was no use. My legs were shattered. My lower body was completely paralyzed.

Then I saw my wife, the mangled corpse of my wife. And Becky. And all the other hikers. They all had wide grins of pure bliss on their lifeless faces. And all I could think was: did I not climb high enough?","i’m a journalist in a small town off the coast. recently, i have stumbled upon something very strange going on in our town. nothing very exciting usually happens here. to give you a picture: the most interesting story last week was a kitten stuck in a tree. yet i have a job to do and sometimes you have to really squeeze a story out of something. you really have to pay attention to the details when interviewing someone, you never know what threads you may unravel. being starved of stories, my wif",en,0.09587198369554903,|the Crooked Mountain,the Crooked Mountain,48.10690000000005,-112.90505999999999,66.912,,,,,,

Tributes have been paid to a British lawyer and his nine-year-old son killed in a landslide while on holiday in Australia.

Mehraab Nazir, 49, had been hiking with his family in the Wentworth Pass area of the Blue Mountains, a national park west of Sydney, on Monday when they were caught in the rockslide. His and his son’s bodies were recovered the next morning.

His wife was in a critical condition in an intensive care unit, while another son, aged 14, had undergone surgery and was in a stable condition. The couple’s 15-year-old daughter, who walked from the scene, was under observation in hospital.

Mehraab Nazir, a graduate from the University of Exeter, was a partner at the law firm Watson Farley & Williams based in its Singapore office, where he worked as a finance lawyer specialising in international transactions, having reportedly moved from London more than 10 years ago.

The company said: “It is with the greatest sadness that we must confirm that our dear friend and colleague Mehraab Nazir, a partner in our Singapore office, tragically lost his life in a landslide in Australia earlier this week alongside his young son. We will be remembering and honouring Mehraab. However, with the surviving members of the family in serious conditions or in shock, we ask that you respect their privacy and grief at this incredibly difficult time.”

A spokesperson for the University of Exeter said: “We are extremely sorry to hear about this tragedy and send our condolences to Mr Nazir’s family, friends and colleagues.”

It was reported the family are Zoroastrians. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported a message on the Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales Facebook page, which described their deaths as an “immense tragedy”. It is understood relatives have arrived in Sydney.

The premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, said the incident was “tragic” and he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open, given recent heavy rain. “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will,” Perrottet told ABC. “Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur, it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

After the bodies were removed, the NSW department of environment and heritage announced that the area was closed to the public until further notice and a “comprehensive review” would be undertaken.

We stand against the Kaliwa Dam Project because this project:

1. Will affect the ancestral domains where 5,000 Dumagat-Remontados are situated; is being expedited by the railroading of its legal process, particularly the right of the Dumagat-Remontados to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent process under IPRA;

2. Will destroy the biodiversity and habitat of 126 species in 300 hectares of the Sierra Madre and endanger 100,000 residents downstream with the risk of massive flooding;

3. Will entail an unnecessary 10.37 billion-peso loan from China, further worsening our debt-ridden economy;

We thus call on President Rodrigo Duterte and all government leaders to revoke the Kaliwa Dam Project. We believe that this project will not address the problem but also make conditions worse for the Philippines. Alternative water solutions that are both cheaper and more sustainable (e.g. watershed rehabilitation, repairing and improving existing dams and water distribution facilities, water conservation policies) have been offered by various experts.

[SIGN THE PETITION](https://www.change.org/p/president-rodrigo-duterte-stop-kaliwa-dam-save-our-future)


STOP THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE KALIWA DAM for the following COMPELLING reasons:

1. IT WILL PLACE 100,000 LIVES IN DANGER.

While Manila is now preparing for the Big One earthquake of the Marikina West Valley Fault, the proposed 60-meter Kaliwa Dam will be constructed within a zone of two active tectonics represented by the Philippine Fault Zone and the Valley Fault System. The Agos Dam site is located only 7-8 kilometers from the Philippine Fault Zone (Infanta Fault). In case an active fault is nearby the proposed dam site, two major problems can occur and will greatly affect the design of the proposed structures, namely: 1.) seismicity caused by the earthquakes occurring in active fault zone; and 2.) deformation in dam-foundation caused by the movement of active faults. Most of the proposed dam sites would be subject to high peak acceleration and are exposed to generally high degree of seismicity.

Along the Philippine Fault, there were many large-scale earthquakes that were recorded in the past and the relative movement of 6 cm was observed in the period of 1991 to 1993. It can be said that the Philippine Fault Zone has a potential to cause very high seismic activity, as what have been recorded in the July 18, 1880 earthquake where the old churches of Infanta, Mauban (both in Quezon province) and Manila Cathedral were devastated (Page 3-11 of the The 2003 results of JICA study “The Study on Water Resources Development for Metro Manila in the Republic of the Philippines”). ”Even with its best technology, Japan was caught flat-footed with its 2011 earthquake”.  


2. IT VIOLATES THE LAW.

To sign the bilateral loan agreement thru ODA for the Kaliwa Dam Project would essentially violate R.A. 8173 and R.A. 7586. Up until now there is no Free, Prior and Informed Consent ever given by the Dumagat-Remontados for this construction as required by R. A. 8173. Neither has there been an Environmental Compliance Certificate as required by R.A. 7586 and yet your advisers have scheduled the signing on November 11, 2018.


3. IT IS A DEBT TRAP 

By refusing to be transparent on the Kaliwa Dam despite your Freedom of Information E.O. 2, your advisers have effectively prevented a solidly based scientific study of the Dam. For all their rhetoric your advisers are paving the way to a debt trap. They are simply duplicating Sri Lanka’s Hambantota airport and seaport experience during the dictatorship of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both airport and seaport became liabilities so much so that Sri Lanka had to lease the seaport for 99 years. Malaysia’s newly elected Mahatir has cancelled projects with China to avoid being trapped. 


4. IT IS IGNORES THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

The collapse of the dams in Vietnam and in Myanmar a few months ago, the Itogon tragedy, the landslide in Naga City, Cebu and the most recent incident in Natonin, Mountain Province are enough signs that the impact of climate change can no longer be ignored. These should teach the Philippines to listen to the recommendation of the World Commission on Dams not to build big dams anymore.


5. THE PHILIPPINES IS FLOODED WITH RAIN WATER. PROMOTE THE FORESTS, NOT DAM PROJECTS.

The proposed NCWS-Kaliwa Dam Project will inundate 291 hectares of forest from the 9,800-hectare forest in Infanta Kaliwa Watershed, including the sacred site of Dumagat-Remontado in the areas of Tinipak in Brgry. Daraitan, Tanay, Rizal. Kaliwa Dam also plans to get 600 MLD (Million Liters per Day) of water in the Kaliwa river thru embarkment dam of 60 meters high, transported via conveyance tunnel with 4 meters in diameter to Tanay &amp; Antipolo Water Treatment Plants. This will greatly affect irrigation system that sustainably supports Infanta rice granary and it  will dry up aquifers supplying ground-water source for Infanta Quezon Water District (IQWD) servicing its populace.

Construction of Big Dams are not the only answer to the impending water crisis in Metro Manila, there are many other sustainable options. Why not fund the protection and rehabilitation of our degraded watersheds and existing dams, and not the construction of another big dams? It is good news for the environment and can save us from global warming, but bad news for the investors who only want profits at the expense of massive deforestation and community dislocations. The government can also mandate rain water collection modules and water conservation measures, especially for the households and big subdivisions / condominiums, as well as companies, industries, factories and hotel operators within the Metro Manila, instead of spending billions for dams  without the assurance of success.

A landslide in a mining location in northwest Colombia killed at least 11 people and injured a dozen more, authorities reported.

According to the Antioquia Risk Management Agency (Dagran), an “unspecified” number of individuals remain missing as a result of the landslide in Abriaqu municipality, which was triggered by heavy rains.

According to the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management, the majority of the deceased are believed to be miners who were working at an unauthorized gold mine that was covered by the landslide in an unpopulated area in Abriaqu.

Authorities are en route to the scene to assist emergency services and examine potential infrastructure damage, according to Dagran.

“We are once again saddened by this scenario. We predicted last Monday that these events would continue to occur, and that while we cannot prevent them because they are natural occurrences, we can prevent loss of life “Jaime Gomez, the director of Dagran, stated.

“People who reside or have activities on the banks of rivers should avoid these tributaries during the wet season. Risk management is a shared responsibility for all Colombians, and it is up to each of us to do our part to safeguard lives “Gomez stated.

Following what he described as a “painful tragedy,” Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria said on Twitter that he will meet with his cabinet and then travel to Abriaqu.

On Thursday, President Ivan Duque extended his condolences to the victims’ families and said that relief agencies are assisting the disaster agency in the search.

“We provide the essential assistance to those who have been affected by the recent torrential rains, which have resulted in this catastrophe. We will continue to keep a close eye on the situation “Duque sent out a tweet.

According to a foreign news website, landslides are widespread in Colombia due to the country’s mountainous geography, regular severe rainfall, and shoddy or improvised housing construction.

According to the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management, the rainy season, which began on March 16, has already wreaked havoc on more than 9,000 individuals across the country.
