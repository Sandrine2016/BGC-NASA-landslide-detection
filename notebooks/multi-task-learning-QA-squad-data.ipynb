According to officials, it would take around 20 days to reconstruct the road as the damage was heavy.\\n\\nAfter the road was washed away, authorities from highways department swung into action and diverted Kodaikanal-bound vehicles through Pattiveeranpattti-Thandikudi road.\\n\\nThough the road, five kms from Dum Dum Parai, has got severely damaged by the landslide, there were no injuries, said officials.\\n\\nKodaikanal hills has been receiving heavy rain after around five years. A heavy rain that started at around 9pm on Sunday continued till midnight which resulted in landslides in many areas of the main Ghat road connecting Batlagundu.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the vehicles coming downwards from the hills to the plains were diverted through Palani road.\\n\\nThe officials said both Palani road and Thandikudi roads are smaller compared to the Ghat Road and heavy vehicles coming to the hills through small roads are crawling resulting in traffic snarls.\\n\\nIn Theni district, heavy rain damaged few houses. The sources said at least two houses were damaged injuring seven people on Sunday night.\\n\\nThe incident took place at Ambedkar Nagar in Periyakulam when Anusuya, 4, Surya, 17, Nagapriya, 18, Gomathi, 18, and Pechiammal, 60, were sleeping in their house.\\n\\nIn another incident, in the same area Malarkodi, 17, and Karupayi, 35, sustained injuries after their house got damaged. They were taken to Periyakulam Government Hospital for treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram KOO APP YOUTUBE',\n",

This closure will extend minimally through next weekend.\\n\\nDue to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.\\n\\nAt this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.\\n\\nEffective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.\\n\\nThe National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.\\n\\nWater levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.\\n\\nKnown damage and issues\\n\\nKnown damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation\\n\\nThe power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.\\n\\nWater and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.\\n\\nStay informed\",\n",
    "        \"Landslides involve the movement of a large mass of earth down a slope and they can be caused by various factors including poor soil structure, rainfall, drought, erosion, and seismic activities (earthquakes). An avalanche is the movement of large snow volumes.\\n\\nWhat is the process of soil creep?\\n\\nSoil creep is a very slow movement, occurring on very gentle slopes because of the way soil particles repeatedly expand and contract in wet and dry periods. When wet, soil particles increase in size and weight, and expand at right angles. … As a result, the soil slowly moves down slope.\\n\\nIs landslide a calamity?\\n\\nLandslides occur when ground on slopes becomes unstable. … Given the nature of such disasters, fast relief and rescue operations are required to get to trapped survivors but this can be delayed due to landslides cutting off easy access to the affected area.\\n\\nWhat is soil creep?\\n\\nSoil creep defines the slow mass wasting process of soil on a slope, under the influence of gravity (Source: Glossary of Soil Science terms, Soil Science Society of America). … It was also stated that the majority of rates of solifluction affected soil movement down to 50 cm of depth.\\n\\nWhat is an example of a soil creep?\\n\\nOne example of soil creep in real life is from the wealthy Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tabogo. … The movement of the soil caused instability and triggered other, more dramatic forms of mass wasting such as debris flows, and the road required reconstruction to combat the one-inch-per-year creep in the area.\\n\\nWhat causes creep movement?\\n\\nCreep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward movement of slope-forming soil or rock. Movement is caused by shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too small to produce shear failure.\\n\\nWhat are 4 types of landslides?\\n\\nLandslides are part of a more general erosion or surficial pro- cess known as mass wasting, which is simply the downslope movement of earth or surface materials due to gravity. They are classified into four main types: fall and toppling, slides (rotational and translational), flows and creep.\\n\\nWhat causes landslide?\\n\\nLandslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris.\\n\\nHow can human activities trigger landslide?\",\n",

    "        \"(His Capture)\\n\\nIt was just after midnight when we got set upon. We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path. We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us. Then we heard the footsteps. Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat. It all went to hell so fast. Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there. Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside. The bastards were everywhere. We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground. They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers. I couldn’t tell you if they were in the hundreds, but they felt like it. My mount took a spear in the hindquarters and buckled. I’ve never hit the ground so hard in my life. Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me. I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me. He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.\\n\\nI went into a tree myself. It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so. The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat. The tree had actually saved me twice over. Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again. Even through the tunnel vision, I could hear and feel the metal getting closed around my wrists, and even though I felt like I was about to die, I knew I wouldn’t, but that I would awaken enslaved. They had shackles. Shackles aren’t rope. They aren’t multi-purpose. They have a singular purpose, and that was my final lamenting thought as the tunnel of darkness closed in on me. My head got weak, and fell into the mud. The last sensation I can remember is the taste of blood and dirt in total, silent darkness.\\n\\nWhen I awoke, I couldn’t move. I was in a pile of my brethren. The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember. Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again. I was the only one awake. Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back. He felt cold, and his body never moved. He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me. Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower. After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath. The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.\\n\\nThe next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water. My lungs were so tired. Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath. Gods, all I wanted was air. All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it. There are moments that humble dwarves. Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people. All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier. I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath. I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled. My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air. My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under. Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain. That’s all there was. In every incarnation.\\n\\nI felt one grab a handful of my hair, all the way down to the scalp and then yank. Most of the hair held, quite a bit didn’t. Fine shale sheered along my right side as he drug me onto the bank, then I watched as they grabbed another of my men from the wagon and heave him into the five foot deep center of the water that did indeed seem to flow down from the glacier atop the Marrowdwell Mountains above. I couldn’t’ recognize him before they threw him. We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.\\n\\nI think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud. Never have I been more proud of my men. There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs. They simply rose, even then. Because that’s what they do. Hurrik, Lembrun, and Hassal. I’m still trying to find them. They came up to me and unfastened my shackles from behind me and when they saw my eyes begin looking around I saw the knives at my men’s throats. There was nothing in their eyes. Nothing. Fucking good lads. My hands were brought to my front and reshackled to match the others’.\\n\\nFour shackled dwarves, and nearly three dozen orc bastards in full arms. My men all exchanged the same look.\\n\\nNot yet.\",\n",

The south loop is accessed from the East (Cody), West (West Yellowstone), and South (Grand Teton/Jackson) entrances. Accessible areas include Madison, Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village and Norris. As part of reopening planning, park staff have engaged over 1,000 business owners, park partners, commercial operators and residents in surrounding gateway communities to determine how to manage summer visitation while the north loop remains closed due to flood damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo balance the demand for visitor access, park resource protection and economic interests of the communities, the park will institute an interim visitor access plan. The interim plan, referred to as the Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), was suggested as a solution by gateway communities during major public engagement with the park this past week. Park managers and partners have agreed this system is the best interim solution to ensuring the south loop does not become overwhelmed by visitors. The National Park Service will actively monitor the license plate system and is concurrently building a new reservation system that will be ready for implementation if needed.\\n\\nAlternating License Plate System (ALPS)\\n\\nPublic vehicle entry will be allowed based on whether the last numerical digit on a license plate is odd or even.\\n\\nEntrance will be granted based on odd/even days on the calendar. Odd-numbered last digits on license plates can enter on odd days of the month. Even-numbered last digits (including zero) on license plates can enter on even days of the month.\\n\\nPersonalized plates (all letters, for example \"YLWSTNE\") will fall into the “odd” category for entrance purposes.\\n\\nPlates with a mix of letters and numbers but that end with a letter (for example \"YELL4EVR\") will still use the last numerical digit on the plate to determine entrance days.\\n\\nEntrance station staff will turn away vehicles attempting to enter the park when the odd/even numerical digits do not correspond to the odd/even calendar date for entrance.\\n\\nExceptions\\n\\nCurrent commercial use operators with active commercial use permits will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes commercial tours and stock groups.\\n\\nVisitors with proof of overnight reservations in the park will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes hotels, campgrounds, and backcountry reservations.\\n\\nCommercial motorcoaches will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number.\\n\\nMotorcycle groups may enter on even dates only.\\n\\nEssential services like mail and deliver, employees and contractors may enter regardless of license plate number.\\n\\nThe interim license plate system will ensure that visitors have access to the park during this period of high demand. Park managers and staff will monitor the license plate system and impacts on resources, infrastructure, operations, and staffing, and may adjust or implement a reservation or timed entry system, if necessary, after three to four weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Less than six days ago, Yellowstone National Park was hit with devastating floods,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams and partners, we are prepared to reopen the south loop of Yellowstone. It is impossible to reopen only one loop in the summer without implementing some type of system to manage visitation. My thanks to our gateway partners and others for helping us work out an acceptable temporary solution for the south loop while we continue our efforts to reopen the north loop. As we go through the reopening process, we will monitor the system’s effectiveness and work together to make adjustments that may be necessary. We will also reopen new sections of the park as repairs continue to be made. It is critical for visitors to stay informed about this interim system as we evaluate its effectiveness. They should plan ahead and be patient with us as we are still managing significant recovery while moving into this operational phase.”\\n\\nOPEN in the south loop as of June 22\\n\\nCLOSED until further notice in the south loop\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit Operating Hours and Seasons for details about what is OPEN and CLOSED throughout the park.\\n\\n\\n\\nYellowstone staff are working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened prior to roads closing Nov. 1. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of park managers to safely open additional sections as the year progresses. Park managers are evaluating plans to reopen roads connecting Canyon Village, Tower Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris; however, this will not happen initially. The park is also working to reconnect Mammoth Hot Springs to Gardiner and Cooke City/Silver Gate as soon as possible with temporary solutions, while long-term reconstruction is planned.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisitors should continue to monitor the park website and for additional updates.\\n\\nUPDATE: June 17\\n\\nYellowstone National Park continues efforts to recover from historic flooding; Limited reopening highly possible next week on park’s south loop with certain visitor entrance modifications\\n\\nVisitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, changes in visitor entry requirements, and road and weather conditions\\n\\nKey Information\\n\\nYellowstone continues major flood recovery efforts in the north while repairing damage and preparing for reopening in the south.\\n\\nAll five park entrances remain closed temporarily, however, West, South, and East entrances are targeted for reopening as early as next week.\\n\\nWater levels remain high but have gone down substantially over the past 24 hours.\\n\\nWeather patterns and potential for additional flooding events are being monitored with the assistance of NOAA and USGS personnel.\\n\\nThe National Park Service (NPS) has engaged over 1,000 partners in surrounding gateway communities, counties and states in the past 96 hours to brief on flood damage impacts and collaborate on reopening strategies.\\n\\nTeams are in the park assessing damage and assisting with short and long-term recovery planning.\\n\\nNPS is analyzing the carrying capacity of the south loop and working closely with partners to develop appropriate visitor management actions to safely accommodate visitors within that portion of the park.\\n\\nNPS is working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened for the season. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of the NPS to safely open additional sections as the year progresses.\\n\\nAlthough access to Yellowstone National Park will be less than normal until further notice, there are still incredible opportunities for recreation, wildlife viewing, and great experiences in the park’s gateway communities (Gardiner, Montana; Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana; West Yellowstone, Montana; Cody, Wyoming; and Jackson, Wyoming), as well as surrounding areas in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. View a list of nearby cities, parks, public lands, and museums to help plan your visit.\\n\\nVisitors who have trips planned should continue to check the Yellowstone website, local chambers of commerce, and social media for updates to get the most up-to-date information.\\n\\nBecause initial damage assessments are ongoing, the NPS does not yet have an estimate on when Yellowstone will fully reopen nor are preliminary costs for repairs and recovery available.\\n\\nTo date, there have been no public or employee injuries reported due to the flood.\\n\\nMessage from the Superintendent\\n\\n“We have made tremendous progress in a very short amount of time but have long way to go,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “All emergency and life safety objectives within the park have been accomplished or stabilized within the first 96 hours of the flood event, without major injury or death. We have an aggressive plan for recovery in the north and resumption of operations in the south. We appreciate the tremendous support from National Park Service and Department of the Interior leadership, in addition to our surrounding Congressional delegations, governors, counties, communities, and other partners.

    "        \"<< First | < Prev | Next >\\n\\n***\\n\\n“So you’re just going to leave, then?” Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”\\n\\nAvians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.\\n\\nPoire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.\\n\\nNow, those siblings were running away. Most of them were avian, but Poire spotted one creature with bulging yellow eyes and green, leathery scales wearing a priest’s walking clothes. Some were rushing. Others tried to move with a quiet dignity, as if they thought they were doing the right thing.\\n\\n“Where are you going to go, then?” Muqwa shouted at the throngs. He pointed at one red-feathered avian. “Sister Inakah, what are you going to do?”\\n\\n“Survive,” Inakah said. She was just as old and round as Muqwa. “At least, I hope to. And if you know better, you will leave too, Muqwa.”\\n\\n“What about the Oracle? What about our order?”\\n\\n“The Oracle is silent, as always.”\\n\\nShe was already walking away.\\n\\n“Brother Osul,” Muqwa called to another avian, who was carrying a bulging knapsack over his shoulder. Silver and other precious metals glinted out of the top. “Are those from the temple? Are you stealing from the gods?”\\n\\n“Mind your own roost, Muqwa. The gods help those who help themselves.”\\n\\nMuqwa opened his mouth to argue when Poire tugged at his robes. Reminding him of their purpose.\\n\\nBut Muqwa was too worked up. His jowls quivered with fury. “You call yourselves faithful. Pwah! Faith would have you here to protect our sacred home from these ransacking cyrans. What if the Savior returns? Where will you be?”\\n\\nOne or two of the priests stopped long enough to look back at Muqwa, at the temple and the tower. But they would not change their minds. The fire over the Midcity was growing taller. The clouds, blacker.\\n\\nBrother Osul, on the other hand, was still standing there, his brow feathers cocked high.\\n\\n“Who’s this?” Osul nodded at Poire.\\n\\n“A lost fledgling, that’s all.”\\n\\nOsul stared.\\n\\nMuqwa put a protective hand out, pushing Poire behind him. “I found him on my way from the garden.”\\n\\nBut the answer didn’t seem to satisfy Osul. Poire could feel the brother’s gaze lingering on his robes, searching for his face beneath the shadow of his hood. Poire shifted uncomfortably, and even his armor began to stir again somewhere beneath his clothes. He pulled his hood tighter over his face.\\n\\nThere was a shout behind them. A patrol of cyrans were shoving one of the priests around, pulling a knapsack off her shoulders and dumping its contents onto the ground. She threw up her hands, letting them take it, letting them tear through the books and papers.\\n\\n“Quickly,” Muqwa whispered to Poire, turning him away from Osul, “let’s get inside before anyone sees you.”\\n\\nThe easternmost tower, just like the leaning tower, was not how Poire remembered it. Huge stone walls had been constructed around the tower, completely walling in the central pylon. Still, the tower was unmistakable. It soared hundreds of feet above the other buildings.\\n\\nArches ringed the base of the tower, forming dozens of entrances to the inner monastery.\\n\\nMuqwa went in first to make sure that it was clear to enter. And then, he beckoned Poire to follow.\\n\\nInside, the sound of the world changed. Footsteps became shuffling echoes, and every breath sounded like the rumbling earth. Torches and pockets filled with candles lit the dusky atrium. There was a kind of excitement in the priest’s gait as he led them down a set of steep, seastone steps that curved around the center of the tower.\\n\\n“Right this way. And watch the stairs, they’re sharp.”\\n\\nThe steps were cramped and worn smooth from centuries of use; Poire’s feet wanted to slip on them. Candles and torches were replaced by gaslights encased in fragile, cloudy glass. A glow ushered in shadows from below.\\n\\nHere, the lights numbered in the hundreds. A cavernous basement stretched as far as he could see, filled to brimming with the steady warmth of lanterns and the glint of gold. Precious metals had been crafted into symbols of the Faith that hung on the walls and the heavy, stone columns. Color had been worked into the stones so that the polished floor was one enormous mural.\\n\\nThe smell of natural gas was so rich it was hard to think. All Poire could hear was the hissing of fuel flowing through a network of pipes that crawled across the corners of the floor.\\n\\nThe ceilings were covered with paintings, flecked and peeling. Each one showed another scene, often of human beings. Sometimes they were tending to plants or feeding animals. This one was a woman whispering into the ear of a bird. Here was a man reaching into the water where a scaled hand rose up to meet his. And directly above Poire was a human sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, a whole forest of trees growing out of his flesh. Each scene was a new masterpiece.\\n\\nThey built all this? Burning gas to see and carving with such crude tools?\\n\\nThere was a gleam of metal from the center of the temple. One of eight pylons, built by humans so long ago. The pylon held up all this stone, just like it once held something else.\\n\\nBut Muqwa drew his attention to an altar covered with a pale linen cloth. Gold stitching embroidered the cloth in an intricate pattern.\\n\\n“There it is.” Muqwa bowed at the altar. “The Oracle.”\\n\\n“It’s a control panel.”\\n\\n“Hmm?” Muqwa said.\\n\\nBut how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.\\n\\nMaybe it still has power, Poire thought.\\n\\n“It looks like it needs maintenance.”\\n\\n“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”\\n\\n“Since when do control panels give instructions?”\\n\\n“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”\\n\\n“You think?”\\n\\n“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed yet. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”\\n\\n“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\nHe hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”\\n\\n“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.\\n\\nPoire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?\\n\\nWhat can you possibly see in me?\\n\\nBeyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.\\n\\nJudging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.\\n\\n“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.\\n\\n“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”\\n\\nMuqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.\\n\\n“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.\\n\\nThis time, Poire thought he knew the answer. The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.\\n\\nBut as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.\\n\\nA shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?\\n\\n“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.\\n\\n“Do you hear anything?”\\n\\nMuqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.\\n\\n“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”\\n\\nCopper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.\\n\\nIs that gas? In open containers? No wonder it was so hard to think down here. Do they know how dangerous that is?\\n\\n“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”\\n\\nPoire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”\\n\\nHe heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.\\n\\n“How—how did you—”\\n\\nAnd then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”\\n\\nAround the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.\\n\\nMuqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.”\\n\\nPoire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”\\n\\n“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”\\n\\nBrother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.\\n\\nPoire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.\\n\\nMuqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.\\n\\n“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”\\n\\nA gunshot.\\n\\nMuqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*\\n\\n“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”\\n\\n“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”\\n\\nPoire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. How is there already so much of it? It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.\\n\\n“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.\\n\\nA faint whisper. “Look.”\\n\\nOne feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. Why is the stupid fool smiling?\\n\\n“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”\\n\\nThe priest’s eyes closed.\\n\\nUnlike the door, they would never open again.\\n\\nTears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.\\n\\n“Grab him.”\\n\\nThe soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of him.\\n\\n“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”\\n\\nPoire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.\\n\\nOne of the cyrans was screaming.\\n\\nPoire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.\\n\\nThe door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.\\n\\nWrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.\\n\\nA machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”\\n\\n***\\n\\nNext >\\n\\n***\\n\\nSupport from readers like you helps me keep this story going!\\n\\n- Buy the book here: https://pshoffman.com/books/\\n\\n- Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/pshoffman\\n\\n- Or just share this story with others!\",\n",
    "        \"Agartala: The incessant rains across the Northeast are now putting pressure on states like Tripura, Mizoram and Barak valley, as the road considered the lifeline for these regions—the National Highway 6—witnessed several landslides, especially in Meghalaya.\\n\\nTripura, for now, seems to be the worst hit due to the disruptions across National Highway 6. Higher officials of the food and civil supplies department said if the road connectivity is restored within a few days, there would be no major effect. However, if the traffic remains disrupted for the long term, a crisis may hit the state markets. “The present stock of food grains is enough for this month. Earlier, large quantities of rice and other essential grains could be transported through railways. In absence of railway services, we are largely dependent on roadways. And definitely, the supply chain needs to remain unaffected when we have only one route operational,” Saradindu Chowdhury, secretary, Tripura Food and Civil Supplies department told EastMojo.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n\\nRailway services were snapped after heavy rains triggered landslides and inundated Haflong railway station. Expectedly, the railway operations are slated to resume on July 10. “As per the reports we have received from the National Highway Authorities, the road will be restored within the next two to three days. We are in constant touch with the highway authorities and accordingly, steps will be undertaken,” principal secretary, transport department told EastMojo.\\n\\nHowever, as per the sources in the food and civil supplies department, the state has a stock of essential food grains for the next ten to fifteen days while the stock of petroleum oil is enough for the next eight to ten days. “The alternative Guwahati-Agartala route through Bangladesh is still operational and IOCL is transporting gas bullets frequently. If the road connectivity also gets halted for a long time, we would be compelled to depend on the transport route through Bangladesh for transit of essentials,” said a top source in the department.\\n\\nMizoram, on the other hand, seems prepared for the floods better than Tripura. For now, according to people EastMojo spoke with, the state has essentials thanks to the road between Silchar and Aizawl which is still functioning. However, if the NH-6 remains out of commission, it will put much more pressure on the state, especially for fuel needs. Petrol pumps across the state witnessed more activity than usual, however, and late on Thursday evening, the state government issued a directive limiting how much petrol a vehicle can buy. According to the state directive, a two-wheeler scooter can buy 3 litres of petrol at a time, while a motorcycle can buy up to 5 litre at a time.

    "        \"Landslides involve the movement of a large mass of earth down a slope and they can be caused by various factors including poor soil structure, rainfall, drought, erosion, and seismic activities (earthquakes). An avalanche is the movement of large snow volumes.\\n\\nWhat is the process of soil creep?\\n\\nSoil creep is a very slow movement, occurring on very gentle slopes because of the way soil particles repeatedly expand and contract in wet and dry periods. When wet, soil particles increase in size and weight, and expand at right angles. … As a result, the soil slowly moves down slope.\\n\\nIs landslide a calamity?\\n\\nLandslides occur when ground on slopes becomes unstable. … Given the nature of such disasters, fast relief and rescue operations are required to get to trapped survivors but this can be delayed due to landslides cutting off easy access to the affected area.\\n\\nWhat is soil creep?\\n\\nSoil creep defines the slow mass wasting process of soil on a slope, under the influence of gravity (Source: Glossary of Soil Science terms, Soil Science Society of America). … It was also stated that the majority of rates of solifluction affected soil movement down to 50 cm of depth.\\n\\nWhat is an example of a soil creep?\\n\\nOne example of soil creep in real life is from the wealthy Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tabogo. … The movement of the soil caused instability and triggered other, more dramatic forms of mass wasting such as debris flows, and the road required reconstruction to combat the one-inch-per-year creep in the area.\\n\\nWhat causes creep movement?\\n\\nCreep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward movement of slope-forming soil or rock. Movement is caused by shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too small to produce shear failure.\\n\\nWhat are 4 types of landslides?\\n\\nLandslides are part of a more general erosion or surficial pro- cess known as mass wasting, which is simply the downslope movement of earth or surface materials due to gravity. They are classified into four main types: fall and toppling, slides (rotational and translational), flows and creep.\\n\\nWhat causes landslide?\\n\\nLandslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris.\\n\\nHow can human activities trigger landslide?\",\n",

    "        \"(His Capture)\\n\\nIt was just after midnight when we got set upon. We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path. We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us. Then we heard the footsteps. Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat. It all went to hell so fast. Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there. Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside. The bastards were everywhere. We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground. They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers. I couldn’t tell you if they were in the hundreds, but they felt like it. My mount took a spear in the hindquarters and buckled. I’ve never hit the ground so hard in my life. Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me. I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me. He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.\\n\\nI went into a tree myself. It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so. The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat. The tree had actually saved me twice over. Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again. Even through the tunnel vision, I could hear and feel the metal getting closed around my wrists, and even though I felt like I was about to die, I knew I wouldn’t, but that I would awaken enslaved. They had shackles. Shackles aren’t rope. They aren’t multi-purpose. They have a singular purpose, and that was my final lamenting thought as the tunnel of darkness closed in on me. My head got weak, and fell into the mud. The last sensation I can remember is the taste of blood and dirt in total, silent darkness.\\n\\nWhen I awoke, I couldn’t move. I was in a pile of my brethren. The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember. Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again. I was the only one awake. Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back. He felt cold, and his body never moved. He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me. Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower. After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath. The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.\\n\\nThe next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water. My lungs were so tired. Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath. Gods, all I wanted was air. All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it. There are moments that humble dwarves. Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people. All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier. I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath. I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled. My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air. My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under. Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain. That’s all there was. In every incarnation.\\n\\nI felt one grab a handful of my hair, all the way down to the scalp and then yank. Most of the hair held, quite a bit didn’t. Fine shale sheered along my right side as he drug me onto the bank, then I watched as they grabbed another of my men from the wagon and heave him into the five foot deep center of the water that did indeed seem to flow down from the glacier atop the Marrowdwell Mountains above. I couldn’t’ recognize him before they threw him. We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.\\n\\nI think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud. Never have I been more proud of my men. There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs. They simply rose, even then. Because that’s what they do. Hurrik, Lembrun, and Hassal. I’m still trying to find them. They came up to me and unfastened my shackles from behind me and when they saw my eyes begin looking around I saw the knives at my men’s throats. There was nothing in their eyes. Nothing. Fucking good lads. My hands were brought to my front and reshackled to match the others’.\\n\\nFour shackled dwarves, and nearly three dozen orc bastards in full arms. My men all exchanged the same look.\\n\\nNot yet.\",\n",

The south loop is accessed from the East (Cody), West (West Yellowstone), and South (Grand Teton/Jackson) entrances. Accessible areas include Madison, Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village and Norris. As part of reopening planning, park staff have engaged over 1,000 business owners, park partners, commercial operators and residents in surrounding gateway communities to determine how to manage summer visitation while the north loop remains closed due to flood damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo balance the demand for visitor access, park resource protection and economic interests of the communities, the park will institute an interim visitor access plan. The interim plan, referred to as the Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), was suggested as a solution by gateway communities during major public engagement with the park this past week. Park managers and partners have agreed this system is the best interim solution to ensuring the south loop does not become overwhelmed by visitors. The National Park Service will actively monitor the license plate system and is concurrently building a new reservation system that will be ready for implementation if needed.\\n\\nAlternating License Plate System (ALPS)\\n\\nPublic vehicle entry will be allowed based on whether the last numerical digit on a license plate is odd or even.\\n\\nEntrance will be granted based on odd/even days on the calendar. Odd-numbered last digits on license plates can enter on odd days of the month. Even-numbered last digits (including zero) on license plates can enter on even days of the month.\\n\\nPersonalized plates (all letters, for example \"YLWSTNE\") will fall into the “odd” category for entrance purposes.\\n\\nPlates with a mix of letters and numbers but that end with a letter (for example \"YELL4EVR\") will still use the last numerical digit on the plate to determine entrance days.\\n\\nEntrance station staff will turn away vehicles attempting to enter the park when the odd/even numerical digits do not correspond to the odd/even calendar date for entrance.\\n\\nExceptions\\n\\nCurrent commercial use operators with active commercial use permits will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes commercial tours and stock groups.\\n\\nVisitors with proof of overnight reservations in the park will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes hotels, campgrounds, and backcountry reservations.\\n\\nCommercial motorcoaches will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number.\\n\\nMotorcycle groups may enter on even dates only.\\n\\nEssential services like mail and deliver, employees and contractors may enter regardless of license plate number.\\n\\nThe interim license plate system will ensure that visitors have access to the park during this period of high demand. Park managers and staff will monitor the license plate system and impacts on resources, infrastructure, operations, and staffing, and may adjust or implement a reservation or timed entry system, if necessary, after three to four weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Less than six days ago, Yellowstone National Park was hit with devastating floods,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams and partners, we are prepared to reopen the south loop of Yellowstone. It is impossible to reopen only one loop in the summer without implementing some type of system to manage visitation. My thanks to our gateway partners and others for helping us work out an acceptable temporary solution for the south loop while we continue our efforts to reopen the north loop. As we go through the reopening process, we will monitor the system’s effectiveness and work together to make adjustments that may be necessary. We will also reopen new sections of the park as repairs continue to be made. It is critical for visitors to stay informed about this interim system as we evaluate its effectiveness. They should plan ahead and be patient with us as we are still managing significant recovery while moving into this operational phase.”\\n\\nOPEN in the south loop as of June 22\\n\\nCLOSED until further notice in the south loop\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit Operating Hours and Seasons for details about what is OPEN and CLOSED throughout the park.\\n\\n\\n\\nYellowstone staff are working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened prior to roads closing Nov. 1. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of park managers to safely open additional sections as the year progresses. Park managers are evaluating plans to reopen roads connecting Canyon Village, Tower Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris; however, this will not happen initially. The park is also working to reconnect Mammoth Hot Springs to Gardiner and Cooke City/Silver Gate as soon as possible with temporary solutions, while long-term reconstruction is planned.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisitors should continue to monitor the park website and for additional updates.\\n\\nUPDATE: June 17\\n\\nYellowstone National Park continues efforts to recover from historic flooding; Limited reopening highly possible next week on park’s south loop with certain visitor entrance modifications\\n\\nVisitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, changes in visitor entry requirements, and road and weather conditions\\n\\nKey Information\\n\\nYellowstone continues major flood recovery efforts in the north while repairing damage and preparing for reopening in the south.\\n\\nAll five park entrances remain closed temporarily, however, West, South, and East entrances are targeted for reopening as early as next week.\\n\\nWater levels remain high but have gone down substantially over the past 24 hours.\\n\\nWeather patterns and potential for additional flooding events are being monitored with the assistance of NOAA and USGS personnel.\\n\\nThe National Park Service (NPS) has engaged over 1,000 partners in surrounding gateway communities, counties and states in the past 96 hours to brief on flood damage impacts and collaborate on reopening strategies.\\n\\nTeams are in the park assessing damage and assisting with short and long-term recovery planning.\\n\\nNPS is analyzing the carrying capacity of the south loop and working closely with partners to develop appropriate visitor management actions to safely accommodate visitors within that portion of the park.\\n\\nNPS is working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened for the season.

View a list of nearby cities, parks, public lands, and museums to help plan your visit.\\n\\nVisitors who have trips planned should continue to check the Yellowstone website, local chambers of commerce, and social media for updates to get the most up-to-date information.\\n\\nBecause initial damage assessments are ongoing, the NPS does not yet have an estimate on when Yellowstone will fully reopen nor are preliminary costs for repairs and recovery available.\\n\\nTo date, there have been no public or employee injuries reported due to the flood.\\n\\nMessage from the Superintendent\\n\\n“We have made tremendous progress in a very short amount of time but have long way to go,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “All emergency and life safety objectives within the park have been accomplished or stabilized within the first 96 hours of the flood event, without major injury or death. We have an aggressive plan for recovery in the north and resumption of operations in the south. We appreciate the tremendous support from National Park Service and Department of the Interior leadership, in addition to our surrounding Congressional delegations, governors, counties, communities, and other partners.

    "        \"<< First | < Prev | Next >\\n\\n***\\n\\n“So you’re just going to leave, then?” Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”\\n\\nAvians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.\\n\\nPoire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.\\n\\nNow, those siblings were running away. Most of them were avian, but Poire spotted one creature with bulging yellow eyes and green, leathery scales wearing a priest’s walking clothes. Some were rushing. Others tried to move with a quiet dignity, as if they thought they were doing the right thing.\\n\\n“Where are you going to go, then?” Muqwa shouted at the throngs. He pointed at one red-feathered avian. “Sister Inakah, what are you going to do?”\\n\\n“Survive,” Inakah said. She was just as old and round as Muqwa. “At least, I hope to. And if you know better, you will leave too, Muqwa.”\\n\\n“What about the Oracle? What about our order?”\\n\\n“The Oracle is silent, as always.”\\n\\nShe was already walking away.\\n\\n“Brother Osul,” Muqwa called to another avian, who was carrying a bulging knapsack over his shoulder. Silver and other precious metals glinted out of the top. “Are those from the temple? Are you stealing from the gods?”\\n\\n“Mind your own roost, Muqwa. The gods help those who help themselves.”\\n\\nMuqwa opened his mouth to argue when Poire tugged at his robes. Reminding him of their purpose.\\n\\nBut Muqwa was too worked up. His jowls quivered with fury. “You call yourselves faithful. Pwah! Faith would have you here to protect our sacred home from these ransacking cyrans. What if the Savior returns? Where will you be?”\\n\\nOne or two of the priests stopped long enough to look back at Muqwa, at the temple and the tower. But they would not change their minds. The fire over the Midcity was growing taller. The clouds, blacker.\\n\\nBrother Osul, on the other hand, was still standing there, his brow feathers cocked high.\\n\\n“Who’s this?” Osul nodded at Poire.\\n\\n“A lost fledgling, that’s all.”\\n\\nOsul stared.\\n\\nMuqwa put a protective hand out, pushing Poire behind him. “I found him on my way from the garden.”\\n\\nBut the answer didn’t seem to satisfy Osul. Poire could feel the brother’s gaze lingering on his robes, searching for his face beneath the shadow of his hood. Poire shifted uncomfortably, and even his armor began to stir again somewhere beneath his clothes. He pulled his hood tighter over his face.\\n\\nThere was a shout behind them. A patrol of cyrans were shoving one of the priests around, pulling a knapsack off her shoulders and dumping its contents onto the ground. She threw up her hands, letting them take it, letting them tear through the books and papers.\\n\\n“Quickly,” Muqwa whispered to Poire, turning him away from Osul, “let’s get inside before anyone sees you.”\\n\\nThe easternmost tower, just like the leaning tower, was not how Poire remembered it. Huge stone walls had been constructed around the tower, completely walling in the central pylon. Still, the tower was unmistakable. It soared hundreds of feet above the other buildings.\\n\\nArches ringed the base of the tower, forming dozens of entrances to the inner monastery.\\n\\nMuqwa went in first to make sure that it was clear to enter. And then, he beckoned Poire to follow.\\n\\nInside, the sound of the world changed. Footsteps became shuffling echoes, and every breath sounded like the rumbling earth. Torches and pockets filled with candles lit the dusky atrium. There was a kind of excitement in the priest’s gait as he led them down a set of steep, seastone steps that curved around the center of the tower.\\n\\n“Right this way. And watch the stairs, they’re sharp.”\\n\\nThe steps were cramped and worn smooth from centuries of use; Poire’s feet wanted to slip on them. Candles and torches were replaced by gaslights encased in fragile, cloudy glass. A glow ushered in shadows from below.\\n\\nHere, the lights numbered in the hundreds. A cavernous basement stretched as far as he could see, filled to brimming with the steady warmth of lanterns and the glint of gold. Precious metals had been crafted into symbols of the Faith that hung on the walls and the heavy, stone columns. Color had been worked into the stones so that the polished floor was one enormous mural.\\n\\nThe smell of natural gas was so rich it was hard to think. All Poire could hear was the hissing of fuel flowing through a network of pipes that crawled across the corners of the floor.\\n\\nThe ceilings were covered with paintings, flecked and peeling. Each one showed another scene, often of human beings. Sometimes they were tending to plants or feeding animals. This one was a woman whispering into the ear of a bird. Here was a man reaching into the water where a scaled hand rose up to meet his. And directly above Poire was a human sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, a whole forest of trees growing out of his flesh. Each scene was a new masterpiece.\\n\\nThey built all this? Burning gas to see and carving with such crude tools?\\n\\nThere was a gleam of metal from the center of the temple. One of eight pylons, built by humans so long ago. The pylon held up all this stone, just like it once held something else.\\n\\nBut Muqwa drew his attention to an altar covered with a pale linen cloth. Gold stitching embroidered the cloth in an intricate pattern.\\n\\n“There it is.” Muqwa bowed at the altar. “The Oracle.”\\n\\n“It’s a control panel.”\\n\\n“Hmm?” Muqwa said.\\n\\nBut how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.\\n\\nMaybe it still has power, Poire thought.\\n\\n“It looks like it needs maintenance.”\\n\\n“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”\\n\\n“Since when do control panels give instructions?”\\n\\n“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”\\n\\n“You think?”\\n\\n“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed yet. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”\\n\\n“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\nHe hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”\\n\\n“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.\\n\\nPoire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?\\n\\nWhat can you possibly see in me?\\n\\nBeyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.\\n\\nJudging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.\\n\\n“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.\\n\\n“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”\\n\\nMuqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.\\n\\n“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.\\n\\nThis time, Poire thought he knew the answer. The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.\\n\\nBut as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.\\n\\nA shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?\\n\\n“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.\\n\\n“Do you hear anything?”\\n\\nMuqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.\\n\\n“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”\\n\\nCopper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.\\n\\nIs that gas? In open containers? No wonder it was so hard to think down here. Do they know how dangerous that is?\\n\\n“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”\\n\\nPoire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”\\n\\nHe heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.\\n\\n“How—how did you—”\\n\\nAnd then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”\\n\\nAround the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.\\n\\nMuqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.”\\n\\nPoire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”\\n\\n“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”\\n\\nBrother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.\\n\\nPoire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.\\n\\nMuqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.\\n\\n“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”\\n\\nA gunshot.\\n\\nMuqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*\\n\\n“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”\\n\\n“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”\\n\\nPoire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. How is there already so much of it? It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.\\n\\n“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.\\n\\nA faint whisper. “Look.”\\n\\nOne feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. Why is the stupid fool smiling?\\n\\n“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”\\n\\nThe priest’s eyes closed.\\n\\nUnlike the door, they would never open again.\\n\\nTears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.\\n\\n“Grab him.”\\n\\nThe soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of him.\\n\\n“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”\\n\\nPoire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.\\n\\nOne of the cyrans was screaming.\\n\\nPoire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.\\n\\nThe door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.\\n\\nWrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.\\n\\nA machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”\\n\\n***\\n\\nNext >\\n\\n***\\n\\nSupport from readers like you helps me keep this story going!\\n\\n- Buy the book here: https://pshoffman.com/books/\\n\\n- Become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/pshoffman\\n\\n- Or just share this story with others!\",\n",
    "        \"Agartala: The incessant rains across the Northeast are now putting pressure on states like Tripura, Mizoram and Barak valley, as the road considered the lifeline for these regions—the National Highway 6—witnessed several landslides, especially in Meghalaya.\\n\\nTripura, for now, seems to be the worst hit due to the disruptions across National Highway 6. Higher officials of the food and civil supplies department said if the road connectivity is restored within a few days, there would be no major effect. However, if the traffic remains disrupted for the long term, a crisis may hit the state markets. “The present stock of food grains is enough for this month. Earlier, large quantities of rice and other essential grains could be transported through railways. In absence of railway services, we are largely dependent on roadways. And definitely, the supply chain needs to remain unaffected when we have only one route operational,” Saradindu Chowdhury, secretary, Tripura Food and Civil Supplies department told EastMojo.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n\\nRailway services were snapped after heavy rains triggered landslides and inundated Haflong railway station. Expectedly, the railway operations are slated to resume on July 10. “As per the reports we have received from the National Highway Authorities, the road will be restored within the next two to three days. We are in constant touch with the highway authorities and accordingly, steps will be undertaken,” principal secretary, transport department told EastMojo.\\n\\nHowever, as per the sources in the food and civil supplies department, the state has a stock of essential food grains for the next ten to fifteen days while the stock of petroleum oil is enough for the next eight to ten days. “The alternative Guwahati-Agartala route through Bangladesh is still operational and IOCL is transporting gas bullets frequently. If the road connectivity also gets halted for a long time, we would be compelled to depend on the transport route through Bangladesh for transit of essentials,” said a top source in the department.\\n\\nMizoram, on the other hand, seems prepared for the floods better than Tripura. For now, according to people EastMojo spoke with, the state has essentials thanks to the road between Silchar and Aizawl which is still functioning. However, if the NH-6 remains out of commission, it will put much more pressure on the state, especially for fuel needs. Petrol pumps across the state witnessed more activity than usual, however, and late on Thursday evening, the state government issued a directive limiting how much petrol a vehicle can buy. According to the state directive, a two-wheeler scooter can buy 3 litres of petrol at a time, while a motorcycle can buy up to 5 litre at a time.
