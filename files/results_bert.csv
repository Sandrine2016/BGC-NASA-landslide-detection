At least 167 people died in landslides and floods after Tropical Storm Megi devastated the Philippines last Sunday.

A further 110 people are missing and 1.9 million have been adversely affected, the national disaster agency says.

Villages around Baybay city in the central Leyte province were badly hit, with hillside avalanches and overflowing rivers.

In one village, Pilar, about 80% of the houses were washed out to sea.

The agency also reported deaths in the southern Davao region, Mindanao and in the central Negros Orientals province.

Many people fled their homes to shelters or higher ground when the storm, known locally as Agaton, hit the archipelago with winds of up to 65km/h (40mph).

Pictures posted by the Philippines Coast Guard show rescuers carrying the injured on stretchers through chest-high water and ferrying survivors on rafts down flooded streets.

The rescue effort was hampered by rain although conditions eased on Tuesday.

It was the first such storm of the year – the Philippines typically sees an average of 20 each year.

It comes about four months after Super Typhoon Rai devastated many of the nation’s south-east islands in December – killing at least 375 people and affecting about 500,000 people.

It was the worst storm to hit the Philippines that year and experts said it had grown stronger far quicker than anticipated.

Marissa Miguel Cano, a public information officer in Baybay, told AFP news agency: “It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that.”

TACLOBAN CITY – What was supposed to be Remigio Mejia’s cheerful celebration of his 50th birthday on Friday (April 15) ended up in mournful vigil for his daughter and granddaughter who died in landslide that swamped villages here during the Tropical Depression Agaton’s onslaught a few days back.

“I gathered my children in our house in Brgy. Maypatag (Ambuhan) from our other house in the barrio in preparation for my birthday. I was supposed to slaughter a pig for the celebration. We were happy before this happened,” recalled Mejia.

He said they were awakened by a loud rumbling noise around 3 a.m. on Monday (April 11) in what turned out to be an experience so tragic and so painful.

“When my wife and son got up, we were blown away by the mud coming from the mountain,” he recalled.

One of his sons was saved when he covered himself under their refrigerator that leaned to the wall.

“I heard my children crying for help. I told my son to call for help while I dug through the mud to save them,” he narrated.

He said that because of the landslide, it took time before the villagers came to help him rescue his children.

“At first I could hear one of them calling for help (Tabang) for about 20 minutes. I tried digging with my bare hands with no light until her voice stopped, then another one cried for help,” he narrated.

Remigio was able to save one of them. However, his 16-year-old daughter and 8-year-old granddaughter were already dead when they found them. That broke his heart.

He said the village chief of Brgy. Imelda was kind enough to allow them to have the vigil in the Brgy. Hall, and let them sleep there together with the families of the other victims.

Meanwhile, Mantesa Polvera and her sister Karen Joy, who both came home from Luzon could also not believe that their whole family was buried alive in the landslide in Brgy. Mailhi.

While they were attending the wake of their mother, three siblings, and two nieces, they found out that their father’s body has been recovered from the rubble.

Their uncle and one other relative remain missing.

Aside from grieving the loss of their loved ones, Mantesa and her siblings are having trouble finding the money for the burial of their family members who perished.

They were grateful for Bernandino Tacoy of BGT Cares Foundation who arrived from a relief operation to the evacuees and extended burial assistance to them.

“This is a huge help for us. We will just go back to Manila because we no longer have a family and home to go to. We will just continue with our lives and offer it all to God even if this is really hard for us,” she lamented.",Families mourn loss of loved ones in Leyte landslides,[],2022-04-15 00:00:00,,"TACLOBAN CITY – What was supposed to be Remigio Mejia’s cheerful celebration of his 50th birthday on Friday (April 15) ended up in mournful vigil for his daughter and granddaughter who died in landslide that swamped villages here during the Tropical Depression Agaton’s onslaught a few days back.

ABUYOG, Leyte – The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by Tropical Storm Agaton (international name: Megi) rose to 148 on Thursday, official figures showed, as more bodies were found in mud-caked villages.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centres.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Agaton— devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog have retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 42 people died in landslides that hit three villages in the municipality, police said. Another person drowned.

Most of those deaths were in Pilar, with at least 28 bodies brought by boat to a sandy lot near the municipal government building after roads leading to the settlement were cut off by landslides.

More than 100 remained missing, and Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP there was little hope of finding anyone else alive.

An aerial photo showed a wide stretch of mud and earth that had swept down a mountain to the sea, crushing everything in its path.

The wreckage of houses and debris was scattered along the shore.

Bad weather and thick mud had complicated retrieval efforts in Pilar, where the ground was unstable. Searchers were also combing the coastline after some bodies were swept kilometres away by ocean currents.

ADVERTISEMENT

“This will not end soon, it could go on for days,” Traya warned.

Many of those who died had hiked to higher ground to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councillor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto, her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Scores missing in Baybay

Another 101 people were killed and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City at the weekend, local authorities said. At least 103 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos, where 42 people died and 93 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when sodden soil shot down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud, which has started to smell of rotting flesh.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, and one person died in the central province of Iloilo, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

“Agaton” struck at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most important holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, when thousands travel to visit relatives.

It came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Philippines — ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change — is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The death toll from landslides and floods that hit the central and southern Philippines after a summer tropical depression unleashed days of pounding rain has risen to at least 43, with 28 others missing, officials said Tuesday.

More than 100 villagers were injured in landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

“We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,” said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Thirty-six of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Seven other people drowned in floodwaters in the central provinces of Samar and Negros Oriental and southern Davao de Oro and Davao Oriental provinces.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay, but continuing rain and muddy ground have hampered the efforts. “The challenge is, it’s continuing to rain and we cannot immediately clear the landslide areas,” Vestuir said.

MANILA, April 17 (dpa): The death toll in landslides and floods caused by this year's first tropical storm in the Philippines has risen to 172, with 110 people still missing, the national disaster agency said Sunday.

Of the victims, 156 were from Leyte province, some 600 kilometres south-east of Manila, where landslides devastated communities in Baybay City and Abuyog town.

At least 104 people were still missing in the two areas, the agency said.

In other affected areas, 16 people were also killed mostly in floods caused by tropical storm Megi, which slammed into the country on April 10, it added.

More than 2 million people in 30 provinces were affected by the storm, which forced more than 207,500 residents to flee their homes and stay in evacuation centre.

Damage to agriculture, houses and public infrastructure was estimated at more than 257 million pesos (5 million dollars), the agency said.

Efforts to search for the missing were continuing despite concerns over the safety of rescuers in the landslide areas, said Mark Timbal, a spokesman for the national disaster agency.

""So far, our search and rescue teams did not stop their operations,"" he told DZBB radio station in Manila. ""More than 300 search and rescue personnel have been deployed to help the victims.""

Timbal urged those who wish to send donations to coordinate with local government units to properly distribute the relief supplies.

""Usually, we need food, water, blankets, and hygiene equipment for those affected,"" he said.

The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by tropical storm Agaton (international name Megi) rose to 133 on Thursday, official figures showed, as more bodies were found in mud-caked villages.

Scores of people are still missing and feared dead after the strongest storm to strike the archipelago nation this year dumped heavy rain over several days, forcing tens of thousands into evacuation centers.

About 114 casualties were from Baybay City, 81, with 59 identified and 22 for identification; Abuyog, 32, with 30 identified and two for identification; and one in Motiong, Samar.

In Baybay alone, five persons had remained missing, including 28-year-old Adrian Paulo Tulin, the son of Visayas State University President, who was swimming on a beach in Barangay Guadalupe on April 10, when Agaton intensified and triggered flooding in the region.

The total number of injured persons was 236, with 106 in Baybay, 128 in Abuyog, and two in Dulag.

Lieutenant Colonel Ma. Bella Rentuaya, the police regional spokesperson, said 589 personnel were deployed for search, rescue, and retrieval operations while 1,580 were on standby.

Aside from police personnel, the Philippine Coast Guard, Philippine Army, Bureau of Fire Protection, Office of Civil Defense, Department of Public Works and Highways, local disaster agencies, and volunteer groups have also deployed teams for the search and retrieval operations in the affected towns.

As of Thursday morning, 52 evacuation centers were occupied by 6,555 individuals or 1,550 families, mainly in the hardest-hit villages of Baybay and Abuyog.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in the region said they sent teams of social workers to Abuyog and Baybay as part of the technical assistance to the municipalities affected by typhoon Agaton.

The social workers assisted in conducting camp coordination, camp management, and internally displaced persons protection in the evacuation centers.

“Aside from this, social workers also set up child and women-friendly spaces and conducted Psychological First Aid or counseling for evacuees who were traumatized due to the storm,” the DSWD said on Thursday.

The agency also loaded additional family food packs for towns affected by Agaton, including 500 initial releases for Mahaplag and 1,447 other family food packs for Abuyog.

The family food packs contained six kilos of rice, four cans of corned beef, two cans of tuna flakes, two cans of sardines, five sachets of coffee, and five sachets of energy cereal drinks, which is enough for two to three days for a family of five.

Based on the information released by Police Regional Office-Eastern Visayas, 41 areas have remained flooded, while 192 were without electricity and 36 were without cellular communication signals.

Authorities said 1,266 persons were rescued, while no looting was reported in the affected areas.

In its latest road advisory, DPWH said Barangay Mailhi in Baybay, where 14 people died due to a landslide, is now one-lane passable.

Commercial flights in the region have also resumed, while no more ships, vehicles, and passengers were stranded in ports and terminals across the region, As of Thursday.

In the central province of Leyte — the worst affected by Megi — devastating landslides smashed farming and fishing communities, wiping out houses and transforming the landscape.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms — including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 — with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Emergency personnel in Abuyog municipality have retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 42 people died in landslides that hit three villages in the municipality, police said. Another person drowned.

Most of those deaths were in Pilar, with at least 28 bodies brought by boat to a sandy lot near the municipal government building after roads leading to the settlement were cut off by landslides.

More than 100 remained missing, and Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP there was little hope of finding anyone else alive.

An aerial photo showed a wide stretch of mud and earth that had swept down a mountain to the sea, crushing everything in its path.

The wreckage of houses and debris were scattered along the shore.

Bad weather and thick mud had complicated retrieval efforts in Pilar, where the ground was unstable. Searchers were also combing the coastline after some bodies were swept kilometers away by ocean currents.

“This will not end soon, it could go on for days,” Traya warned.

Many of those who died had hiked to higher ground to avoid flash floods, villagers told AFP.

“It sounded like a helicopter,” said Pilar councilor Anacleta Canuto, 44, describing the noise made by the landslide.

Canuto, her husband and their two children survived, but they lost at least nine relatives.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the landslide hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Scores missing in Baybay

Another 86 people were killed, and dozens injured in vegetable, rice and coconut-growing villages around Baybay City at the weekend, local authorities said. At least 117 are still missing.

The hardest hit was Kantagnos, where 32 people died and 103 have not been found.

In the nearby village of Bunga, 17 people perished when sodden soil shot down a hill and slammed into the riverside community. Only a few rooftops are visible in the mud, which has started to smell of rotting flesh.

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, and one person died in the central province of Iloilo, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

Another three deaths previously reported in the central province of Negros Oriental were dropped from the tally after they were found to be unrelated to the storm.

Megi struck at the beginning of Holy Week, one of the most important holidays in the mainly Catholic nation, when thousands travel to visit relatives.

It came four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Many of the dead were caught in landslides triggered by torrential rain from Tropical Storm Megi.

The death toll from landslides and floods in the Philippines has risen to 67 with scores missing and feared dead, officials said, as rescuers dug up more bodies with bare hands and backhoes in crushed villages.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi – the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago this year – were in the central province of Leyte.

Thirteen people died and around 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality, after a torrent of mud and earth pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Traya told AFP, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said.

A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar.

She said she tried to outrun it, but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto told AFP by telephone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

Disaster-prone Philippines is regularly ravaged by storms – including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 – with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Baybay City is also reeling after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements over the weekend, killing at least 48 people and injuring over 100, local authorities said. Twenty-seven are still missing, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

‘Many of us died’

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

The death toll from Megi is expected to rise as rescue operations switch to recovering bodies.

Abuyog police chief Captain James Mark Ruiz said more boats were needed for victims in Pilar. But getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiber glass boats and there are steel bars exposed in the sea so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing too”.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

The death toll from landslides and floods in the Philippines rose to 58 on Wednesday, official tallies showed, as rescuers dug up more bodies with their bare hands in villages crushed by rain-induced avalanches.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi — the strongest to hit the disaster-prone archipelago this year — were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

At least 47 people died and 27 were missing after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements around Baybay City over the weekend, local authorities said. More than 100 people were injured, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Search operations for survivors in Pilar village — part of Abuyog municipality in Leyte — resumed at first light on Wednesday, with boats carrying rescuers to the coastal community of around 400 people.

The operation came a day after a landslide pushed many houses in the village into the sea.

“We have five casualties, one unidentified,” Captain James Mark Ruiz of Abuyog police told AFP.

Ruiz said more boats were needed to rescue victims and retrieve bodies in the ongoing search after landslides cut off road access to the community.

Around 50 survivors have been ferried from the village, the Bureau of Fire Protection said on Facebook on Tuesday.

Photos posted by the agency showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

Medical workers rushed to treat victims as they were brought to shore, applying bandages to cuts and providing emergency blankets. One woman had her right arm in a splint.

Raymark Lasco, a radio operator at the Abuyog disaster agency, told AFP that “many people” had died and that rescue operations were ongoing.

Port operations suspended

Search operations also resumed around Baybay City after the rain stopped, enabling emergency personnel to access hard-hit areas, Mayor Jose Carlos Cari told CNN Philippines.

“In some barangays (villages), we’re just doing retrieval,” Cari said.

Rescuers have been using their bare hands and shovels to reach victims buried by the landslides.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook on Tuesday showed rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher from one of the devastated villages, while other victims were piggybacked to safety.

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection personnel in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by bad weather.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

Megi came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned that typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the planet becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines — ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts — is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Search efforts will continue in villages buried beneath mud with dozens of people still missing.

The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by Tropical Storm Megi has risen to at least 115, as search teams found more bodies in mud-buried villages.

Eighty-six of the casualties were in Baybay, a mountainous area prone to landslides in central Leyte province, where 236 people were also injured, the city government said in a report.

Megi was the first tropical storm this year to hit the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands.

Dozens of people are still missing and feared dead after several days of torrential rain with tens of thousands of people forced into evacuation centres.

Emergency teams retrieved dozens of bodies from the coastal village of Pilar, which was destroyed by a landslide on Tuesday.

At least 26 people were killed there and about 150 remain missing, authorities said, with little hope of finding anyone else alive.

Many of those who died had hiked up the mountain to avoid flash floods, villagers told the AFP news agency.

Pilar fisherman Santiago Dahonog, 38, said he rushed into the sea with two siblings and a nephew as the mud hurtled towards them.

“We got out of the house, ran to the water and started swimming,” he told AFP. “I was the only survivor.”

Three people also drowned on the main southern island of Mindanao, the national disaster agency said in its latest update.

“The search, rescue and retrieval operations will continue,” a Philippine Army infantry unit in Baybay said on Facebook.

Aerial photographs and video from the local government showed collapsed slopes, burying coconut plantations and houses in dirt and mud. In one area, rescuers had to use rubber boats to reach a landslide.

Megi made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65 kilometres (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80 kph (49 mph), but has since dissipated.

The Philippines, ranked among the nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

In Abuyog, 32 persons, 29 of whom were residents of Barangay Pilar, had been retrieved.

The number of fatalities in the two landslide-hit areas was expected to increase as retrieval operations continued.

Anamelle Bantaculo, village councilor of Kantagnos, one of the worst-hit areas in Baybay, appealed for help, especially food, water, medicine, blanket, and even tarpaulin for residents, who survived the mudslide but lost their homes.

“Our gymnasium is now occupied by 65 families. I’m asking people to help us even by providing tents for affected families, especially those who lost their homes,” she said.

In Abuyog, about 43 kilometers away from Baybay City, 32 people died due to a landslide.

Fr. Amadeo Alvero of the Palo Archdiocese and part of the Caritas in Palo said he did not expect the tragedy to happen.

“I talked to some survivors who thought they could not survive. Indeed most of them were still shocked. Many of them shared that they made a great run for them to survive. And they prayed hard, calling God to spare their lives,” he said.

“Many are still waiting for the missing members of their families as the rescuers continue to retrieve bodies from the rubbles,” he added.

Residents believed 177 persons were missing from Pilar, a village located at the foot of a mountain where the landslide originated.

On Wednesday, Social Welfare Secretary Rolando Joselito Bautista visited Baybay City and went to the villages of Bunga and Katagnos where he extended financial assistance to affected families.

Most of the deaths from tropical storm Megi—the strongest to hit the archipelago this year—were in the central province of Leyte, where a series of landslides devastated communities.

Twenty-six people died and around 150 were missing in the coastal village of Pilar, which is part of Abuyog municipality after a torrent of mud and earth on Tuesday pushed houses into the sea and buried most of the settlement, authorities said.

“I have to be honest, we are no longer expecting survivors,” Abuyog Mayor Lemuel Traya told AFP, adding that emergency personnel were now focused on the difficult task of retrieving bodies.

About 250 people were in evacuation centres after being rescued by boat after roads were cut by landslides, he said.

A number of villagers were also in hospital.

A rumbling sound like “a helicopter” alerted Ara Mae Canuto, 22, to the landslide hurtling towards her family’s home in Pilar.

She said she tried to outrun it, but was swept into the water and nearly drowned.

“I swallowed dirt, and my ears and nose are full of mud,” Canuto told AFP by telephone from her hospital bed. Her father died and her mother has not been found.

The disaster-prone region is regularly ravaged by storms—including a direct hit from Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013—with scientists warning they are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of human-driven climate change.

Baybay City is also reeling after waves of sodden soil smashed into farming settlements over the weekend, killing at least 48 people and injuring over 100, local authorities said. Twenty-seven are still missing, they added.

Aerial photos showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga village, where only a few rooftops poked through the now-transformed landscape.

“We were told to be on alert because a storm was coming, but they did not directly tell us we needed to evacuate,” said Bunga farmworker Loderica Portarcos, 47, who lost 17 relatives and a friend in the landslide.

Portarcos braved heat and humidity as she advised a backhoe operator where to dig for three bodies still embedded in the soft soil which had started to smell of rotting flesh.

“Our dead relatives are all in the morgue, but there will be no time for a wake to mourn them because the mayor told us they smell bad,” she said.

‘Many of us died’

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

The death toll from Megi is expected to rise as rescue operations switch to recovering bodies.

Black body bags containing 26 victims from Pilar were laid out on sand in Abuyog for relatives to identify on Wednesday.

Abuyog police chief Captain James Mark Ruiz said more boats were needed. But getting access to the shore was difficult.

Photos posted by the Bureau of Fire Protection on Facebook showed buildings crushed or turned over by the force of the landslide and debris in the water.

“We’re using fiber glass boats and there are steel bars exposed in the sea so it’s very difficult,” Abuyog Mayor Traya said, adding that the ground was unstable and “very risky”.

While Pilar survivor Canuto counts herself lucky to be alive, she said “many of us died and a lot are missing too”.

Whipping up seas, Megi forced dozens of ports to temporarily suspend operations, stranding thousands of people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year in the Philippines.

It came four months after super typhoon Rai devastated swathes of the country, killing more than 400 and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

The Philippines—ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change—is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Two people have died and two others are fighting for life after a landslide on a walking track in the Blue Mountains, about 100km from Sydney.

Emergency services were called about 1.30pm after reports of the accident involving a group of five walkers on a track near Wentworth Falls.

NSW police acting superintendent John Nelson said a man and a boy died at the scene of the accident. A woman and a boy were in a critical condition, and a girl was walking out from the site with the assistance of authorities, he said.

Nelson described the accident as tragic and said the girl was extremely distressed.

NSW ambulance acting chief superintendent Stewart Clarke said the two critically injured patients had suffered significant head and abdominal injuries. They would be sedated and intubated before being winched to a helicopter and flown to hospital, he said.

The scene that had confronted paramedics was “exceptionally confronting and heartbreaking”, he said, especially as it involved children. The girl had been uninjured but would be assessed again by paramedics and offered pastoral care once she returned to Wentworth Falls.

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” Clarke said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.

“This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

Nelson said the site was incredibly dangerous and unstable after the accident but conditions in general had been favourable for walking on Monday and the track had been open, despite recent flooding in the area.

“Obviously there’s been a major weather event – I can’t comment on the condition of this walking track.”

Nelson said the ages of those involved in the accident, and whether or not they were locals, had not been confirmed.","Two dead, two critical after landslide in Blue Mountains",['Nino Bucci'],2022-04-04 00:00:00,,"Two people have died and two others are fighting for life after a landslide on a walking track in the Blue Mountains, about 100km from Sydney.

A British father and son have been killed in a landslide in Australia, with two other family members left fighting for their lives.

The tragic incident took place in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, with a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy declared dead at the scene.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched from the location in critical condition, according to New South Wales Police.

The last member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was walked back by emergency services - an hour-and-a-half trek from the scene - and has been taken to a children’s hospital. The young girl, who escaped the landslide, reportedly raised the alarm in call to the emergency services at around 1:30pm, Mail Online reported.

The distraught teenager allegedly told the operator: “I don’t know where we are.” The family were holidaying in Australia and had gone walking in the mountains.

The 15-year-old girl was “extremely distressed” following the incident, the authorities said. “We’ve focused on caring for her while the best medical care is given to her mum and brother and just trying to get that support for the 15-year-old,” said Supt John Nelson from New South Wales Police.

At around 1.40pm local time on Monday, emergency services were called to Wentworth Pass, Wentworth Falls, after “reports of a concern for welfare for five bushwalkers”, police said in a statement.

The bodies of the British father and his 9-year-old son have now been recovered, police confirmed on Tuesday.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he will be investigating whether the walking track should have been open at the time.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Corportation: “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will.

“Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

Police said on Monday: “Despite efforts by emergency services, two people – a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy – died at the scene.

“Just before 6pm, a 50-year-old woman and second boy – aged 14 – were winched from the location and taken to Westmead Hospital and the children’s hospital at Westmead, both in critical conditions.”

Det Supt John Nelson, from the Blue Mountains area command, told reporters: “It’s quite a tragic scene. We do have a girl who is walking out at the moment and is clearly extremely distressed.”

NSW Ambulance Acting Ch Supt Stewart Clarke said that the area the family had been walking in was extremely dangerous and unstable.

He added: “This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” he said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.”

Paramedics reportedly said that the injured hikers had suffered head and abdominal injuries.

The distraught teenager allegedly told the operator: “I don’t know where we are.” The family were holidaying in Australia and had gone walking in the mountains.

The 15-year-old girl was “extremely distressed” following the incident, the authorities said. “We’ve focused on caring for her while the best medical care is given to her mum and brother and just trying to get that support for the 15-year-old,” said Supt John Nelson from New South Wales Police.

At around 1.40pm local time on Monday, emergency services were called to Wentworth Pass, Wentworth Falls, after “reports of a concern for welfare for five bushwalkers”, police said in a statement.

The bodies of the British father and his 9-year-old son have now been recovered, police confirmed on Tuesday.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he will be investigating whether the walking track should have been open at the time.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Corportation: “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will.

“Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur it would be remiss of any government not to act.”

Police said on Monday: “Despite efforts by emergency services, two people – a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy – died at the scene.

“Just before 6pm, a 50-year-old woman and second boy – aged 14 – were winched from the location and taken to Westmead Hospital and the children’s hospital at Westmead, both in critical conditions.”

Det Supt John Nelson, from the Blue Mountains area command, told reporters: “It’s quite a tragic scene. We do have a girl who is walking out at the moment and is clearly extremely distressed.”

NSW Ambulance Acting Ch Supt Stewart Clarke said that the area the family had been walking in was extremely dangerous and unstable.

He added: “This was a really complex and delicate rescue operation for our crews who were working to access patients in rugged bushland and were navigating unstable ground.”

“This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved and a truly tragic ending to what I’m sure was meant to be a pleasant day out,” he said.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event.”

Paramedics reportedly said that the injured hikers had suffered head and abdominal injuries.

A British Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia.

We are in contact with the local authorities.”","a british father and son have been killed in a landslide in australia, with two other family members left fighting for their lives.  the tragic incident took place in the blue mountains, west of sydney, with a 49-year-old man and a nine-year-old boy declared dead at the scene.  a 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched from the location in critical condition, according to new south wales police.  the last member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was walked back by emergency service",en,0.14602538169202697,landslide,,Blue Mountains,-33.71330999999998,150.3306500000001,1.4455,2022-04-04 00:00:00,2022-04-04 23:59:59,"2022/04/04, 11:59",12.0,

As search and rescue efforts increased with the arrival of equipment, the death toll has risen to at least 56, with 28 others missing, after a summer tropical depression that unleashed days of pounding rain caused landslides and floods in the central and southern Philippines, officials said Wednesday.

Nearly 200 villagers were injured mostly in the landslides in the hard-hit city of Baybay in central Leyte province over the weekend and early Monday, officials said. Army, police and other rescuers were struggling with mud and unstable heaps of earth and debris to find the missing villagers.

More rescuers and heavy equipment, including backhoes, arrived in the landslide-hit villages in Baybay. Its mayor, Jose Carlos Cari, said the weather cleared Wednesday, allowing the search and rescue work to go full force.

""We're looking for so many more missing people,"" Cari said and added that authorities would do a recount to determine how many villagers were really missing and believed buried in the landslides.

Forty-seven of the dead were recovered from the landslides that hit six Baybay villages, military and local officials said. Nine other people drowned elsewhere in floodwaters in four central and southern provinces, they said.

""We are saddened by this dreadful incident that caused an unfortunate loss of lives and destruction of properties,"" said army brigade commander Col. Noel Vestuir, who was helping oversee the search and rescue.

Coast guard, police and firefighters rescued some villagers Monday in flooded central communities, including some who were trapped on their roofs.

Torrential downpours and flooding have triggered mudslides, killing at least 45 people in South Africa.

Water poured through the city of Durban and surrounding areas in KwaZulu-Natal province on Tuesday. Local officials expect the death toll to rise after a number of people were swept away.

Several hundred people have lost their homes and belongings, and electricity has been cut off to a number of areas.

The city’s port, the largest and busiest in sub-Saharan Africa, and major highways suffered major damage due to sustained rainfall which burst banks of rivers and led to surging waters. Dozens of shipping containers were pictured in the floodwaters, buckled and cracked open.

Transnet, which runs the Durban port, said in a statement that operations had been suspended due to the extreme downpours and high winds.

South Africa’s military has been deployed to Durban and the surrounding eThekwini metropolitan area on Tuesday to help with rescue efforts locally.

More heavy rain was forecast in the coastal city through this evening.

Recent extreme rainfall in southeast Africa has become more intense and damaging due to the climate crisis, a team of international scientists reported earlier this week.

The World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said that climate change made destructive downpours more likely during back-to-back storms in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in early 2022.

Between January and March, southeast Africa was hit by three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms in just six weeks – with more than a million people affected by extreme rainfall and severe flooding, and some 230 recorded deaths.

“Again we are seeing how the people with the least responsibility for climate change are bearing the brunt of the impacts,” said Dr Friederike Otto, who is part of the WWA which analyses the links beween climate change and extreme weather events.

“Rich countries should honour their commitments and increase much-needed funding for adaptation, and for compensating the victims of extreme events driven by climate change with loss and damage payments.”",Mudslides and flooding kill at least 45 people in South Africa,[],2022-04-12 22:00:17+00:00,,"Torrential downpours and flooding have triggered mudslides, killing at least 45 people in South Africa.

JUNEAU, Alaska – A woman filmed herself escaping the path of a rockslide near Juneau, Alaska, last week and then frantically rushed to save drivers from getting killed.

Alana Davis was recording footage on TikTok from a beach along the Douglas Highway on April 6 when the rockslide happened.

Video shows her interrupted mid-sentence by a crashing noise. She immediately grabs her camera and runs for safety, waving her arms and shouting at highway traffic to stop.

“Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop your car!” she yelled while trying to catch her breath.

Davis said a man driving a pickup was about to encounter a blind turn on the highway while traveling at 50 mph.

“Literally 30 seconds from getting killed. Think about that,” the man told Davis.

“I ran screaming down the road, just so you know, on the beach flailing my arms,” she replied.

Landslide and debris flow warning signs include a faint rumbling sound that increases in volume and is noticeable as the landslide nears, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.

Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities spokesman Sam Dapcevich said about 500 cubic yards of material fell to the road from a cliff about 500 feet up the hillside near mile 11 of North Douglas Highway on April 6. Crews immediately responded and cleaned up the slide debris to reopen the highway.

On April 10, a second slide took place at the same location with approximately twice the quantity of material reaching the road, including several car-sized boulders that bounced across the road and over the guardrail, finally landing on the beach or in the water.

“Our maintenance and operations foreman was there working on cleanup when the second slide came down, and he took action to keep traffic from passing through,” Dapcevich said.

As of Wednesday, both lanes are cleared, but the road will remain closed while geologists monitor the site. A geotechnical team is gathering imagery with a drone as weather conditions allow.

“It was very windy during both slide events, many tree roots are now exposed that appear to have grown in the rock crevices. The wind moving the trees likely jostled the rock and could have been the cause of both slides. There’s still a lot of rock up there that could come down in the future,” Dapcevich said.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Heavy rains caused mudslides that killed at least 14 people in southerncoastal cities and the Baixada Fluminense area of Rio de Janeiro state, according to state and local authorities on Saturday.

Rescuers answered 850 calls in the last 24 hours and were able to bring 144 people to safety in the affected regions, state authorities said.

Rio de Janeiro has been hit by inclement weather over the past few weeks. Landslides and flooding in February killed some 240 people in the Petropolis area, in the hills above Rio de Janeiro, authorities said on March 23.

“We have more than 70 homeless families. We are providing shelters and renting hostels for these people,” Luciano Vidal, the mayor of Paraty, told Reuters.

He said mudslides blocked streets and isolated parts of the city, and entire neighborhoods were without electricity in the colonial coastal town that is a tourist attraction.

In one day, Paraty received 322 millimeter (12.68 inches) of rain, the rainfall average for six months. At least seven people died there, Vidal said. The civil defense statement only confirmed five deaths in Paraty.

The town, a tourist destination, declared a state of emergency as more rains were forecast.

In nearby Angra dos Reis, also a tourist destination hit by heavy rainfall, at least sixpeople died, the latest state tally showed.

Manila Philippine authorities said on Monday at least 25 people had died in landslides and floods caused by tropical storm Megi as it hit the eastern and southern coasts of the Southeast Asian country.

The storm -- known in the Philippines as Agaton -- made landfall on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 65 kilometers (40 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 80 kph (49 mph). Megi is the first storm this year to hit the archipelago, which sees around 20 such storms annually.

In the eastern province of Leyte, the bodies of 22 people were recovered after being buried under a landslide, Joemen Collado, police chief of Baybay city, told reporters.

The national disaster agency, which has also said three people had died in the southern Davao region, said the reported casualties are still subject to verification.

""There were landslides in communities and then some of the victims were swept by floods,"" Collado said, adding that rescue operations are ongoing as at least six more people are missing.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummelled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 21 people were dead after landslides slammed into several villages in Leyte province -- one of the hardest hit by the storm -- local authorities said.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Photos showed the rooftops of several homes in Bunga, one of the Leyte communities affected, poking above a river of mud.

Rescue efforts were focused on the nearby village of Kantagnos, which an official said had been hit by two landslides.

Some residents managed to escape or were pulled out of the mud alive, but many are still feared trapped.

Five people have been confirmed dead in Kantagnos, but it is not clear how many are still missing.

A Philippine Coast Guard video shared on Facebook showed six rescuers carrying a mud-caked woman on a stretcher to safety.

“There was a small landslide and some people were able to run to safety, and then a big one followed which covered the entire village,” Jose Carlos Cari, mayor of Leyte’s Baybay City, told local broadcaster DZMM Teleradyo.

“We’re looking for many people, there are 210 households there.”

Cari said the bad weather was hampering rescue efforts.

“We’re pushing, but we’re having a hard time because it’s dangerous,” he said.

“Equipment has been mobilised, everything is ready, but we’re unable to move because it’s still raining heavily and rivers are still swollen.”

The military has joined coast guard, police and fire protection officers in the search and rescue efforts.

National disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said landslides around Baybay City had reached settlements “outside the danger zone”, catching many people by surprise.

“There were people in their homes that were hit directly by the landslide,” Timbal told AFP.

Tropical storm Megi -- known in the Philippines by its local name Agaton -- is the first major storm to hit the country this year.

Whipping up seas, it forced dozens of ports to suspend operations and stranded nearly 8,000 people at the start of Holy Week, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

The Philippines re-opened to fully vaccinated tourists from most countries in February after lifting practically all Covid-19 restrictions, and Easter is a popular holiday for domestic tourists.

The storm comes four months after a super typhoon devastated swathes of the archipelago nation, killing more than 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.

Scientists have long warned typhoons are strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer due to climate change.

The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to its impacts -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.

Rescuers hampered by mud and rain on Tuesday used their bare hands and shovels to search for survivors of landslides that smashed into villages in the central Philippines, as the death toll from tropical storm Agaton rose to 42.

More than 17,000 people fled their homes as the storm pummeled the disaster-prone region in recent days, flooding houses, severing roads and knocking out power.

At least 36 people died and 26 were missing after landslides slammed into multiple villages around Baybay City in Leyte province – the hardest hit by the storm – local authorities said. Just over 100 people were injured.

Three people were also killed in the central province of Negros Oriental and three on the main southern island of Mindanao, according to the national disaster agency.

Most of the deaths in Leyte were in the mountainous village of Mailhi where 14 bodies were found, Army Captain Kaharudin Cadil told AFP.

“It was a mudflash that buried houses. We recovered most of the bodies embedded in the mud,” said Cadil, spokesman for the 802nd Infantry Brigade.

Drone footage showed a wide stretch of mud that had swept down a hill of coconut trees and engulfed Bunga, another community devastated by the storm.

At least seven people had been killed and 20 villagers were missing in Bunga, which was reduced to a few rooftops poking through the mud.

“It’s supposed to be the dry season but maybe climate change has upended that,” said Marissa Miguel Cano, public information officer for Baybay City, where 10 villages have been affected by landslides.

Cano said the hilly region of corn, rice and coconut farms was prone to landslides, but they were usually small and not fatal.

Apple Sheena Bayno was forced to flee after her house in Baybay City flooded. She said her family was still recovering from a super typhoon in December.

“We’re still fixing our house and yet it’s being hit again so I was getting anxious,” she told AFP.

Two days of heavy rain trigger flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state.

Torrential rains have triggered flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state, killing at least eight people including six children and leaving 13 missing, authorities said on Saturday.

Two days of heavy rain have battered a broad swath of the southeastern state’s Atlantic coast, the latest in a series of deadly storms in Brazil that experts have said are being aggravated by climate change.

The latest floods and landslides come six weeks after flash floods and landslides killed 233 people in the scenic city of Petropolis, the Brazilian empire’s 19th-century summer capital, also in Rio state.

This time, the areas hit hardest included the tourist town of Paraty, a seaside colonial city known for its picturesque cobblestone streets and colourful houses.

Officials on Saturday there said a landslide in the Ponta Negra neighbourhood had killed a mother and five of her children, ages two, five, eight, 10 and 15.

A sixth child was rescued alive and taken to the hospital, they said.

In all, seven houses were swept away in landslides in the city, and another four people injured. Seventy-one families were forced from their homes, officials said.

Two more victims were killed in the cities of Mesquita and Angra dos Reis, where another 13 people remain missing, said Congressman Marcelo Freixo, who represents the state of 17.5 million people.

In Angra, the victim was a four-year-old girl buried in a landslide, while in Mesquita, 40km (25 miles) northwest of Rio de Janeiro city, a 38-year-old man was electrocuted trying to help another person escape the flooding, media reports said.

The storms turned streets into rivers in several cities on Friday night, sweeping up cars and triggering landslides – a frequent tragedy in the rainy season, especially in poor hillside communities.

Officials in Angra said the city had received 655 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 48 hours, “levels never before registered in the municipality”.

The federal government said it had sent military aircraft to help the local rescue effort, and dispatched national disaster response secretary Alexandre Lucas to the state.

Experts have said rainy season downpours in Brazil are being augmented by La Nina – the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean – and by the impact of climate change.

As a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

In January, torrential rain triggered floods and landslides that killed at least 28 people in southeastern Brazil, mostly in Sao Paulo state.

There were also heavy rains in the northeastern state of Bahia, where 24 people died in December.","Brazil: Floods and landslides kill eight, 13 missing",[],2022-04-02 00:00:00,,"Two days of heavy rain trigger flash floods and landslides across Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state.

British Columbia experienced devastating landslides and flooding last fall after torrential rain fell on regions scarred by wildfires, a nd more of these events are likely coming soon . A study published Friday in Science Advances found that under a high- emissions scenario—in a world where we do nothing to stop current levels of emissions—the frequency of back-to-back wildfires and rainfall events would increase seven times by 2100 in the Pacific Northwest and become twice as likely in California. The combo of fire and rain sets the stage for landslides , which can sweep away homes in an instant.

“We know those things are happening anyway, so let’s think about how likely it is within a single year both of them would happen—a fire, and then a rainstorm afterwards,” Samantha Stevenson, an assistant professor of environmental science at University of California, Santa Barbara and a coauthor of the study, told Earther. “We care about that because that has a much bigger impact than either of those things just happening individually.”

Both wildfires and heavy rainfall can be devastating on their own, but when rain falls on areas that haven’t fully recovered from fire, the effects can be catastrophic. Wildfires burn off a crucial layer of vegetation that helps to capture some of the water during rainfall, slowing down the water on its way into the soil. When heavy rains fall on areas scarred by wildfires, that barrier doesn’t exist, making debris flows (the more scientifically appropriate name for “mud slides,” since a lot of stuff besides mud can get caught up in the currents) much more likely. Fires also change the chemical composition of the soil itself, causing runoff to increase and upping the likelihood of severe erosion in certain areas.

T he study, which uses climate modeling to run different scenarios, examines the chance that wildfires and rainfall will coexist in a certain time period. “If you have two sets of dice, and one is for fire weather, and one is for rain, you could roll those independently, and some of the time you’d come up with, say, a six, and you’d get extreme fire or extreme rainfall,” Stevenson said. “That would happen by chance anyway. But what climate change is doing is loading those dice, so you’re more likely to get those extreme values.”

The findings aren’t particularly surprising; t he IPCC report published last year clearly laid the links between climate change supercharging rainstorms as well as helping wildfires get bigger and more destructive. B ut they’re extremely worrisome, given how devastating extreme rainfall can be to areas that have recently burned. Folks in the Pacific Northwest got a taste of what this future could look like last fall, when an atmospheric river dumped a torrent of rain on parts of British Columbia that had suffered through wildfires that summer. Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from towns and cities in the region, while at one point every major highway out of Vancouver was closed. Officials had to rescue nearly 300 people, including dozens of children, off a highway after they became trapped overnight by water, rocks, and mud.

Importantly, the study’s findings operate under a “business as usual” emissions scenario— projections that do not take into account any sort of climate action whatsoever and which are (hopefully) an overshoot of what actually will happen at the end of the century as the world tries to take decisive climate action now. However, even if the doomsday numbers the report projects are an overshoot, climate change has already upped the risk of wildfires and rainfall occurring in tandem.

Shillong: In an unfortunate incident in Meghalaya, two persons including a 14-year-old minor boy, lost their lives due to landslides that occurred on Monday.



The incident took place in the Mawlat village under Mawkynrew block which is in the East Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya.

The deceased person has been identified as Dilibon Tangsang 35 years old, a resident of Mawkria village and Rohit Kshiar 14 years old, a resident of Mawlat village.

According to reports, the two persons met with the incident and lost their lives when they were passing through the area and the unprecedented landslides occurred.

There have been several landslides reportedly occurring in different parts of the state causing extreme harm to life, property and infrastructure.

In another landslide incident reported from the state, two residences and two establishments were damaged at the Umblai village which is in the Shella Bholaganj Tehsil of East Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya.

Landslides were also reported from Lyngshing village, where five houses were damaged along with vehicles and public properties being destroyed in the region.

In the Lyngshing village, one person identified as Hame Bina has even sustained injuries following the ground movements that took place at her house

Officials informed that a residence belonging to Phrangi Khongjoh is partially destroyed while one of the residences belonging to a person named Kro Kshiar was fully damaged in the landslides.

Meanwhile, other areas of the state that witness landslides are Shillong-Dawki Road, Wahumkhrah River under Lawmali Quarter, Thangbnai- Mawlyngot, Mawpglang Balat Road under Mawsynram Block.

As informed by sources, as many as seven landslides were seen in several regions of Meghalaya on Monday.

The concerned officials rushed to the spot hit by landslides in Meghalaya and distributed blankets and foodgrains to the families affected.

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Landslides are an act of nature that cost a lot of money to repair. Unfortunately, more and more keep popping up across the City of Pittsburgh.

KDKA Investigator Meghan Schiller wanted to find out how many landslides are on the city's list for monitoring and if the list is growing faster than in years past.

Only on KDKA: we took concerned residents' questions straight to Eric Setzler, the City of Pittsburgh's lead engineer.

KDKA first reported on the El Paso Street slide in Morningside on Feb. 16, but its appearance has deteriorated in the past month and a half. Setzler tells KDKA it's up next for repairs.

We interviewed concerned neighbors along El Paso Street in Morningside who tell KDKA that the mailman and delivery trucks are struggling to maneuver the narrowing roadway.

""It stopped at the bottom of my deck and the deck tipped over,"" said neighbor Collen Crnkovich.

We highlighted the disappearing Bon Air backyards along Drycove Street and talked to neighbors who fear the city will condemn their homes as their legal bills pile up.

""I have no place to go during the wintertime, during the pandemic,"" said neighbor Mary Kaye-Kienke.

State Rep. Emily Kinkead is pushing for funding to help homeowners like Kaye-Kienke stuck with high bills to repair landslides on their properties. She previously proposed House Bill 1054, hoping to create a way to help these homeowners since no home insurance will cover the cost.

""We don't have anything, like nothing exists to help people recover,"" said Kinkead.

Jersey barriers recently popped up on Andover Terrace in North Oakland. Neighbors say the street is shifting and pulling away from the sidewalk.

""I hope they're gonna fix it after all,"" said neighbor Della Pennywell.

It's a safety issue with no quick fix.

""Whoever owns the land that slides is responsible for fixing the landslide,"" said Setzler.

He admits it's not something in the budget for most homeowners.

""I mean it's hard enough for the city to have enough resources to fix these landslides, how can you expect the typical homeowner?"" he said.

But if the slide involves city property, like a street, stairs or ""right of way,"" it's his department's responsibility. He's tracking more than 100 slides right now.

""Probably in the range of 120 landslides that we're aware of and not all of those necessarily require any action,"" said Setzler. ""We have 75 that we're monitoring or keeping an eye on.""

It's expensive to do the research, complete a design and initiate the fix. Setzler tells KDKA the city's spending about $5 million each year to fix the slides.

""And honestly that's probably not enough,"" he said.

But he said it's a balancing act. The city's also paying to fix sidewalks, stairs and bridges.

Setzler tells KDKA that the residents of El Paso Street will see work begin shortly.

""It's very close to the end of the design process and we'll be putting it up to bid for construction, but that was a pretty big landslide, and it took a while to get through the design process,"" he said.",Pittsburgh Tracking Over 100 Active Landslides,[],2022-04-04 00:00:00,,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Landslides are an act of nature that cost a lot of money to repair.

The bodies of a British father and son have been recovered from the Blue Mountains, after they were killed in a “freak” landslide.

Police said the bodies of a nine-year-old boy and his 49-year-old father were recovered near Wentworth Pass at around 9.30am on Tuesday.

Five members of the same family were caught in the landslide on Monday while on holiday in Australia from the UK.

A 50-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were winched out and taken to hospital on Monday afternoon with significant head and abdominal injuries.

Police say they have undergone surgery and remain in critical conditions.

A fifth member of the family, a 15-year-old girl, was treated for shock after the landslip on a walking track, which was reported to emergency services about 1.40pm on Monday.

The Wentworth Pass track is a steep and difficult 5km loop, that encompasses waterfalls and valley views and can take up to five hours to complete.

A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said the track had been inspected in the days before the incident.

“The site is currently closed and a comprehensive review will be undertaken,” they said.

“The walking track where this incident occurred was inspected in the days before the rockslide as part of a routine track assessment program.

“NPWS has a world class program in place to assess geotechnical risks and maintain the safety of walking tracks and other infrastructure to the greatest extent practicable. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict and eliminate all natural risks such as rockslides, which can occasionally occur around the state.

“All of us at NPWS extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and those affected.”

NSW Ambulance chief superintendent Stewart Clarke told Sunrise earlier on Tuesday that all indications were that it was a “freak accident.”

“Everything we can glean from the notes during the calls [indicates] that certainly it was a freak accident.

“What was concerning more so after the fact was the concern that there were still noises being heard after the initial impact, which poses a significant risk to the patients as well as our people being sent in.”

Clarke added that a multi-agency rescue effort was launched on Monday afternoon to rescue the family, which included NSW police, Fire and Rescue NSW and NSW SES.

“These people who work tirelessly for us are the best in what they do,” Clarke said.

“They are highly trained and highly skilled but that doesn’t negate the intense risk assessments that were carried out at the time to ensure they were able to use these skills safely to access the patients to deliver some high level clinical care.”

NSW police Det Acting Supt John Nelson said: “Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they’ve been bushwalking. It’s quite a tragic scene.”

He described the 15-year-old as being “extremely distressed”.

“Both patients have significant head and abdominal injuries requiring sedation and intubation prior to them being extricated via winch,” Clarke told reporters on Monday.



The landslip had occurred in an “extremely dangerous, extremely unstable environment”, Clarke said, describing the situation as heartbreaking.

“It is terribly sad to have lost two lives here today and my heart goes out to the families and the survivors of this horrific ordeal who have witnessed what is certainly a traumatic event,” Clarke said.



He described the rescue operation as “complex and delicate”, with crews working hard to access patients in rugged bushland and on unstable ground.

Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill told the Guardian the local community was heartbroken by the tragedy.

“Whether resident here or not, those who come to our beautiful Blue Mountains are taken into our hearts, and moments like this cause pain and grief to our entire community.”

“This was the holiday of a lifetime for a family that came from overseas, and has ended in unspeakable tragedy, and our whole community feels this.”

While the incident did not occur on council jurisdiction, Greenhill said the Blue Mountains City Council was working with National Parks and Wildlife Service in assessing walking tracks in the area.

Significant rain is predicted later this week. “As a result, Blue Mountains national park will be closed, except for Evans and Govetts Leap lookouts, from 9am” on Wednesday, the NPWS said in a statement on Tuesday.

Greg Tannos runs Find My Australia, a sports and recreation blog, and walked the Wentworth Pass track two days before the tragic landslip, saying he didn’t see anything dangerous.

“I actually thought the trail was quite OK when we walked it. These more off the grid tracks are a little less maintained, but that’s normal, most people won’t go that far down.

“I honestly didn’t think the trail looked damaged, and it didn’t seem to be overly soggy or wet down there.”

Tannos said he was shocked to hear of a landslide on the track calling it “just a terrible tragedy”.

“We passed over a small slide, but it looked like it had been there for a few months, there was nothing dangerous. There was nothing that gave me an indication something like this would happen.

The death toll due to Typhoon “Agaton” has climbed to 137 and this is feared to further increase as over two dozens more are still missing in landslide-hit areas in Eastern Visayas (Region 8), the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported on Good Friday, April 15.

NDRRMC Executive Director Ricardo Jalad said in a situational report that 130 deaths were still undergoing verification while seven deaths – six in Western Visayas (region 6) and one in Eastern Visayas – were already confirmed by the national disaster council.

In Leyte province, 128 people were reported dead in Baybay City and in the municipality of Abuyog where rampaging mud and soil buried several residential houses at the height of the storm earlier this week.

Aside from this, six persons in Western Visayas and three others in Davao (Region 11) were previously reported killed by the NDRRMC due to flooding and landslide.

“We are racing against time because the longer it gets, the harder it is for our rescuers to retrieve the victims,” Jalad said during a visit to Barangay Kantagnos, Baybay City on Maundy Thursday.

This will make it hard for authorities to verify the identities of the victims especially in Baybay City where 27 out of the 28 missing persons were reported, Jalad explained.

However, rescuers could not operate in certain areas in Baybay City, such as in Barangay Kantagnos, due to safety issues.

“We have to prioritize the safety of responders. We cannot penetrate the landslide area yet because the soil is still soft. It would be too dangerous for them,” the NDRRMC chief stressed.

Jalad also visited the Abuyog Community College in Abuyog town to personally oversee the situation of the evacuees, and the ongoing response operations and post-disaster activities.

“We have two primary efforts: first is to secure the welfare of evacuees which is being led by the local government units and supported by DSWD and other agencies. Second is the search, rescue and retrieval [operations] undertaken by the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine Army, Philippine Coast Guard, and response units of LGU),” he said.

Currently, the number of affected persons due to Agaton has ballooned to 494,607 families or 1,689,436 individuals.

The typhoon also displaced a total of 153,694 families or 323,306 individuals, including more than 218,000 who were staying in 1,033 evacuation centers.

The estimated cost of damage to agriculture due to Agaton was pegged at P186,632,976.31 which were incurred in Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao (Region 10), Soccsksargen (Region 12), and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

Meanwhile, damage to infrastructure was placed at P6,950,000.","137 dead, 28 missing: Race against time for rescuers in landslide-hit Eastern Visayas",[],2022-04-15 00:00:00,,"The death toll due to Typhoon “Agaton” has climbed to 137 and this is feared to further increase as over two dozens more are still missing in landslide-hit areas in Eastern Visayas (Region 8), the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) reported on Good Friday, April 15.

TACLOBAN CITY – Abuyog, Leyte is appealing for help as one of its coastal villages has been hit by a landslide triggered by massive flood brought by Tropical Depression ‘Agaton’ Tuesday afternoon (April 12).

Initial information from the Bureau of Fire Protection revealed that about 80 percent of Brgy. Pilar has been damaged.

Rescuers in Abuyog are calling for more boats to speed up the transport of rescued victims since most of the road are blockaded by big boulders and uprooted trees.

More medical volunteers are also badly needed to help the medical teams attend to the injured victims.

Abuyog, the largest town in Leyte in terms of land area, had been submerged in neck-deep flood last Sunday.

A landslide in the nearby village of Bahay also claimed two lives, and a 10-year-old male from Brgy. Tic-o.

The Foreign Office confirmed it was “providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia” and that it was in contact with local authorities.

New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet called the incident “tragic” and said he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open given recent heavy rain.

“These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will,” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

A landslide in a mining location in northwest Colombia killed at least 11 people and injured a dozen more, authorities reported.

According to the Antioquia Risk Management Agency (Dagran), an “unspecified” number of individuals remain missing as a result of the landslide in Abriaqu municipality, which was triggered by heavy rains.

According to the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management, the majority of the deceased are believed to be miners who were working at an unauthorized gold mine that was covered by the landslide in an unpopulated area in Abriaqu.

Authorities are en route to the scene to assist emergency services and examine potential infrastructure damage, according to Dagran.

“We are once again saddened by this scenario. We predicted last Monday that these events would continue to occur, and that while we cannot prevent them because they are natural occurrences, we can prevent loss of life “Jaime Gomez, the director of Dagran, stated.

“People who reside or have activities on the banks of rivers should avoid these tributaries during the wet season. Risk management is a shared responsibility for all Colombians, and it is up to each of us to do our part to safeguard lives “Gomez stated.

Following what he described as a “painful tragedy,” Antioquia Governor Anibal Gaviria said on Twitter that he will meet with his cabinet and then travel to Abriaqu.

On Thursday, President Ivan Duque extended his condolences to the victims’ families and said that relief agencies are assisting the disaster agency in the search.

“We provide the essential assistance to those who have been affected by the recent torrential rains, which have resulted in this catastrophe. We will continue to keep a close eye on the situation “Duque sent out a tweet.

According to a foreign news website, landslides are widespread in Colombia due to the country’s mountainous geography, regular severe rainfall, and shoddy or improvised housing construction.

According to the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management, the rainy season, which began on March 16, has already wreaked havoc on more than 9,000 individuals across the country.

CNN —

At least 11 people have been killed and a dozen injured following a landslide in a mining area in northwest Colombia, authorities reported Thursday.

An “unspecified” number of people remain missing due to the landslide in Abriaquí municipality, which was caused by heavy rains, the risk management agency of Antioquia (Dagran) said.

Most victims are believed to be miners, who were working at an unofficial gold mine that was covered by the landslide in an unpopulated area in Abriaquí, the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said.

Authorities are moving toward the site to support emergency services and assess possible damage to infrastructure, Dagran said.

“This situation once again fills us with sadness. Last Monday, we emphasized that these events will continue to occur, and we cannot avoid them because they are natural phenomena, but we can avoid loss of life,” Dagran’s director Jaime Gomez said.

“We’re in the rainy season, so people who live or have activities on the banks of rivers mustn’t be near these tributaries. Risk management is an issue of co-responsibility of all Colombians, and it depends on all of us to do what we can to protect life,” said Gomez.

Antioquia Gov. Anibal Gaviria said on Twitter that he will meet with his cabinet and then travel to Abriaquí following what he called a “painful tragedy.”

President Ivan Duque expressed his solidarity with the families of the victims on Thursday, and said relief agencies are engaged in search operations with the disaster agency.

“We make available the necessary help to attend to the victims of this tragedy caused by the heavy rains of the last few hours. We will maintain permanent monitoring of the situation,” Duque tweeted.

Landslides are common in Colombia due to the mountainous terrain, frequent heavy rains and poor or informal construction of houses, Reuters reported.

The rainy season, which began on March 16, has already wreaked havoc on more than 9,000 people across the country, the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management said.

British lawyer, son killed in Australia landslide

By: ShelbinMS

A British lawyer and his nine-year-old son were killed in a landslide while hiking in the Blue Mountains, Australia, media reports said.



Mehraab Nazir, 49, and his family were on a trip to Sydney from their home base in Singapore. They moved from London more than 10 years ago, reports added. The tragic landslide on Monday (4) came after a week of torrential rainfall in the area.

Nazir’s wife Anastasia, 40, 14-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter were rescued from the scene. According to reports, the two teenagers have been reunited with their godmother while their mother remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Reports highlighted that the 15-year-old daughter escaped the landslide physically unscathed and raised the alarm in a frantic call to emergency services at around 1.30pm. Hailed as a ‘hero’, she walked from the scene with the help of emergency crews, which involved trekking for an hour-and-a-half along the hiking track.

After the bodies of Nazir and his son were removed from the area on Tuesday (5), the New South Wales Department of Environment and Heritage announced a “comprehensive review” into what happened would take place.

Nazir was a partner in law firm Watson Farley & Williams. He was specialised in complex cross-border finance transactions with a particular focus on the transportation and energy sectors.

Some of Nazir’s relatives have already arrived in Sydney while others are still making the trip.

The family are part of the Zoroastrian religion, one of the world’s oldest faiths which is based in Iran and follows the teachings of the ancient prophet Zoroaster.

A member of the religious community said they’re mourning such a ‘tragic loss’.

“While we all still come to terms with this immense tragedy, the outpour and generosity of our community is very heart-warming,” said a spokesman from the Australian Zoroastrian Association. “There is much grief among both the London and Sydney Zoroastrian community for this family tragedy.”

British High Commissioner to Australia Vicki Treadell issued a statement early on Wednesday (6) confirming she is assisting the family.

Media reports said that the family were permitted to use the advanced Wentworth Pass track, famous for its stunning waterfall views and valley lookouts, despite weeks of wild weather making the area dangerous for hikers.

Authorities are still working to determine whether the landslide fell on the group while they were walking along a bush track, or if they were trekking along the cliff face that fell. Police crews returned to the scene early on Tuesday morning to recover the bodies of the victims, reports further said.","British lawyer, son killed in Australia landslide",[],2022-04-06 18:36:21+00:00,,"British lawyer, son killed in Australia landslide
