Flooding and landslides triggered by torrential rain have now killed at least 106 people in northeastern Brazil, officials said Tuesday as emergency workers continued a desperate search.

The force of the landslides ripped apart houses in neighborhoods including Jardim Monteverde, a poor community just outside the city of Recife. Locals have likened the roaring surge of mud to a tsunami.

""It was a tragedy. I lost a lot of friends,"" 49-year-old resident Maria Heronize told AFP on the verge of tears.

Rescue teams have found dozens of bodies buried after floodwater tore through the neighborhood on Saturday.

Six more bodies -- the last of those reported missing in the neighborhood -- were recovered Friday, bringing the search there to an end, the Pernambuco state government said.

Elsewhere, at least eight people remain missing, said disaster management officials for the state, scene of the latest in a series of deadly weather disasters to hit Brazil in recent months.

Crews are using dogs trained to sniff for people and planes to locate the missing.

At least 24 municipalities in Pernambuco have declared a state of emergency and more than 6,000 people have lost their homes or been forced to flee.

President Jair Bolsonaro posted a video on Twitter on Monday that showed him flying in a helicopter over the disaster zone, where brown flood water inundated large areas and gashes of mud scarred hillsides where houses once stood.

""I tried to land, but the pilots' recommendation was that, given the instability of the soil, we could have an accident. So we decided against it,"" the far-right president told a news conference.

He recalled a string of devastating floods in Brazil that have killed hundreds of people in recent months, and which experts say are being aggravated by climate change.

The rains began last week but intensified over the weekend. Overnight Friday into Saturday, the rain that fell in some parts of Pernambuco was 70 percent of what would be normal for the whole month of May.

""We never saw so much rain fall in so little time,"" said 60-year-old retiree Mario Guadalupe.

""I saw the landslide happen. First part of the hill gave way, then it was just a tsunami of mud. It nearly took out my house.""

Weather-related tragedies are becoming a familiar script in Brazil. They tend to hit hardest in poor neighborhoods, especially hillside favelas, or slums.

""Climate change could be responsible for the rise in extreme, violent rain that is being detected not only in Brazil but around the world,"" Jose Marengo, research coordinator at the National Center for Natural Disaster Monitoring and Alerts, told AFP.

In February, 233 people were killed in floods and landslides in the historic southeastern city of Petropolis, in Rio de Janeiro state.

In January, torrential rains claimed at least 28 lives in southeastern Brazil, mostly in Sao Paulo state. The storm victims included an 11-year-old girl.

Also in January, 10 people died when a cliff collapsed onto tourist boats on a lake in a terrifying incident caught on video. Heavy rain may have precipitated the collapse, firefighters said.

Residents look at the site of a landslide caused by heavy rains at Jardim Monte Verde, in the Ibura neighbourhood of Recife, Brazil on May 29, 2022.

Torrential rains in northeastern Brazil have left at least 79 people dead and dozens missing, civil defense officials said Sunday, as rescuers capitalised on a lull in downpours to search for survivors.

""As of 6:00 pm (2100 GMT) this Sunday, the number of people killed as a result of the rains has reached 79,"" the civil defense authority of Pernambuco state, where the affected communities of Recife and Olinda are located, said in a statement.

The disaster is the latest in a recent series of deadly landslides and floods triggered by extreme weather in Brazil.

The number of dead has mounted steadily over the weekend, including dozens in landslides, as heavy rains caused rivers to overflow and torrents of mud swept away everything in their path.

The latest statement from the civil defense did not offer an update on the number of people missing, though the agency had earlier reported 56 people still unaccounted for and nearly 4,000 who had lost their homes.

""We still don't have an exact number, but there are still reports of victims... who have not been found,"" Pernambuco Governor Paulo Camara said during a press conference.

""The search will continue until we can identify all the missing people,"" he said.

Authorities warned that rain was forecast to continue Monday, but in the meantime while the storm subsided some 1,200 personnel -- some in boats or helicopters -- resumed search and rescue work, state officials said.

Minister of Regional Development Daniel Ferreira urged caution in a press conference Sunday in Recife, the capital of hard-hit northeastern Pernambuco state.

""Although it has stopped raining now, we are forecasting heavy rains for the next few days,"" he said.

""So the first thing is to maintain self-protection measures.""

Between Friday night and Saturday morning, rainfall volume reached 70 percent of what was forecast for all of May in some parts of Recife.

'Difficult'

Images circulated on local media showed rescue workers and volunteers clearing heaps of debris in Jardim Monteverde, on the border between Recife and the municipality of Jaboatao dos Guararapes, where 19 died Saturday morning in a landslide that ripped through precariously built homes.

Luiz Estevao Aguiar, who lives in a different municipality, lost 11 relatives in the disaster, he told TV Globo.

""My sister, my brother-in-law, 11 people from my family died. It was difficult... I did not expect this,"" he said tearfully.

Nearby, Flavio Jose da Silva has been desperately looking for his stepfather Gilvan in the rubble of what was once his house.

Shortly after it collapsed, he heard Gilvan say, ""I'm here, under the ground.""

""We hope to find him alive,"" an emotional da Silva said, pointing to a mountain of debris.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Sunday he would travel to Recife on Monday.

Over the past year, hundreds of Brazilians have died in flooding and landslides brought on by torrential downpours.

In February, more than 230 people were killed in the city of Petropolis, the Brazilian then-empire's 19th-century summer capital, in Rio de Janeiro state.

Early last month 14 more were killed by flooding and landslides in the state.

Experts say Brazil's rainy-season downpours are being augmented by La Nina -- the cyclical cooling of the Pacific Ocean -- and by climate change.

Because a hotter atmosphere holds more water, global warming increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

Risks from heavy rains are augmented by topography and poor construction in shantytowns built in steep areas.

According to meteorologist Estael Sias of the MetSul agency, the heavy rains lashing Pernambuco and, to a lesser extent, four other northeastern states, are the product of a typical seasonal phenomenon called ""eastern waves.""

He explained that those are areas of atmospheric disturbance that move from Africa to Brazil's northeastern coastal region.

""In other areas of the Atlantic this instability forms hurricanes, but in northeastern Brazil it has the potential for a lot of rain and even thunderstorms,"" he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO- Over 100 people are missing or confirmed dead in Brazil, the government said on Sunday, as mudslides and major floods brought about by heavy rains tore through several urban neighborhoods in the northeastern part of the country.

It was the fourth major flooding event in five months, underlining a lack of urban planning in low-income neighborhoods throughout much of Brazil, where shantytowns are often built on hillsides prone to collapse. The destruction also comes as scientists begin to question whether abnormal rain cycles in Latin America`s largest nation could be a result of climate change.

As of Sunday afternoon, 56 people had died in the northeastern state of Pernambuco and one died in the neighboring state of Alagoas, according to a message posted on Twitter by the Federal Civil Defense service, which is in charge of emergency management. Another 56 people in Pernambuco were missing.

Flooding in Brazil/CNN

The Brazilian state of Pernambuco is suffering from the effects of bad weather. At least 84 people died due to rainstorms and landslides, thousands of people were left homeless.

On Wednesday, May 25, heavy rains began in the region, so fourteen municipalities declared a state of emergency. Also, 56 people are missing, and almost 4,000 people have their homes destroyed.

Consequences of the floods in Brazil

in high-risk areas around the city of Recife, seek shelter elsewhere after rain triggered heavy landslides and shelters for displaced families opened in the city's schools.

Brazil's northeast is suffering from massive rainfall, officials say. In some areas during the 24-hour period, rainfall was recorded more than the average for the entire month.

Rain will continue

In some parts of the state on Monday, May 30, rain subsided somewhat as the showers moved towards the coast. But weather forecasts are disappointing: in the state of Pernambuco, another 30-60 mm of precipitation will fall in the next two days, while in some areas this amount will reach 100 mm.

Overall, the region could receive most of the expected monthly rainfall in just four days. Strong gusts of wind that can lead to power outages and destruction can reach speeds of 100 kilometers per hour.

This downpour is the fourth major flooding in the last five months in Brazil. The number of destructions highlights the lack of urban planning in low-income areas across much of the country. Favelas – wilds or slums – are often built on hillsides prone to landslides, which increases the danger for their inhabitants.

The reaction of the authorities

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that the military will provide assistance to the victims and that he will visit Recife on Monday to assess the situation.

State Governor Paulo Cámara said his office has provided BRL 100 million ($21 million) to help rain-stricken areas. Seven other Brazilian states offered help and sent rescuers to Pernambuco.","Terrible downpours and landslides in Brazil: 84 people died, almost 4 thousand – homeless – News",[],None,,"Flooding in Brazil/CNN

Hundreds of state and federal rescue workers would resume searching on Tuesday for 26 people unaccounted for, said officials.

Heavy rains lashed Pernambuco last week, triggering landslides on Friday that wiped away housing in poor neighbourhoods or favelas built on hillsides that are prone to such natural disasters.

On Monday, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, flew over the affected area of Pernambuco’s capital, Recife, and neighbouring Jaboatao dos Guararapes. Speaking to reporters afterward, he said that landing in the helicopter was not possible due to the soaked soil.

He noted Brazil had recently experienced similar disasters in the mountains above Rio de Janeiro, in southern Bahia state, and in Minas Gerais state.

“Ka mua, ka muri.” We walk backward into the future, with our eyes on the past. This whakataukī (proverb) represents a New Zealand Māori perspective that has much in common with the way Earth scientists study natural hazards. Understanding and learning from historical events inform our preparedness for and increase resilience against future disasters. Studying past tsunami events, for example, is an important part of better understanding the diverse and complex mechanisms of tsunami generation and for improving natural hazard assessments.

Tsunamis are dangerous natural hazards and are most often caused by earthquakes. Consequently, coseismic tsunamis have drawn most of the focus from researchers and hazard planners. However, several recent tsunamis have been attributed to other sources on which less research has been done, including underwater landslides, as in the case of the Palu, Indonesia, event in 2018, and volcanic eruptions in the case of the tsunami originating from Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai in early 2022.

The Tasman Sea, located between Australia and New Zealand and known for its notorious storms amid the “roaring forties” latitudes, may have witnessed a series of devastating tsunamis during the past 5 million years (i.e., in the Pliocene and Pleistocene, or Plio-Pleistocene, epochs). These tsunamis likely originated near New Zealand’s western coast and traveled more than 2,000 kilometers to also affect Australia, yet intriguingly, there is little easily observable evidence of these events. This tumultuous history is surprising considering that western New Zealand is not especially exposed to subduction zone processes and their associated seismic activity; such exposure is often the main indicator of how vulnerable a coastline is to a tsunami. However, New Zealand is surrounded by steep and, in some cases, tectonically active submarine slopes, where landslides can occur.

Fig. 1. The study area of the Silent Tsunami project is shown here, along with seafloor bathymetry and existing seismic reflection data. The outline of the most recent giant landslide from the Pleistocene is also shown and is overlain by the ship track from the TAN2111 voyage in October 2021.

In the past few decades, evidence of six giant underwater landslides dating from the Plio-Pleistocene has been discovered beneath the modern seafloor in the eastern Tasman Sea (Figure 1). The most recent, thought to have occurred about 1 million years ago, is the largest documented landslide in New Zealand, covering more than 22,000 square kilometers—an area larger than Wales. With a volume of about 3,700 cubic kilometers, this landslide was bigger than the famous tsunamigenic Storegga Slide, which involved massive collapses of the continental shelf off the coast of Norway roughly 8,200 years ago.

Can scientists use these landslide deposits to derive credible indications of past tsunamis? If so, how can we assess the modern potential for hazardous tsunamis based only on these ancient, buried remnants? Underwater landslides are not comprehensively included as tsunami sources in New Zealand’s hazard assessments. This data gap exists largely because of a lack of research into underwater landslide return rates (a statistical measure of how often these events are likely to recur) and tsunamigenic mechanisms, as well as of uncertainties introduced by errors in available dating methods and the difficulty and expense of obtaining samples. These key questions and issues are currently being addressed by a trans-Tasman team of researchers, including us, from Australia and New Zealand under the Silent Tsunami project (officially named Assessing Risk of Silent Tsunami in the Tasman Sea/Te Tai-o-Rēhua), which began in 2021.

Search Strategy for Landslide Evidence

The unstable sediment piles, perched precariously at the interface between the Pacific and Australian plates, inevitably then collapsed in catastrophic fashion several times over.

Throughout the Plio-Pleistocene, a vast volume of material was eroded from the rapidly uplifting Southern Alps, on New Zealand’s South Island, and delivered to the coast by river networks. Powerful ocean currents then transported the sediment north to the country’s northwestern continental margin. The ocean basin duly accommodated the relentless influx of material, and the margin rapidly prograded (built outward toward the sea) via a series of spectacular, steeply dipping depositional surfaces (up to 1,500 meters tall) called sigmoidal clinoforms, which are the building blocks of deltas and basin margins. The unstable sediment piles, perched precariously at the edge of the tectonically hyperactive interface between the Pacific and Australian plates, inevitably then collapsed in catastrophic fashion several times over.

However, evidence of these Tasman Sea landslides cannot be readily observed, in part because of a lack of detailed seafloor mapping in the area but also because the slides were quickly buried under other sediment. Compounding the difficulty are the erosion and uplift of New Zealand’s dynamic coastline, which have erased potential land-based geological evidence in the form of tsunami deposits. Only past seismic reflection surveying in the area enabled the discovery of evidence for these events (Figure 1), with geologists documenting the landslide deposits while mapping New Zealand’s offshore sedimentary basins.

The new project takes a three-pronged approach to carry earlier findings forward. First, we’re combining tools and techniques from the playbook used to analyze the formation and evolution of sedimentary basins, especially how the basin filling process interacts with tectonic processes. These methods include the conversion of time series seismic reflection data into depth measurements using seismic wave velocities measured from drill holes (meaning the depth for each data point is known) and virtually stripping away overlying sediments (back stripping) using computational models. This approach allows us to unearth accurate original volumes (areal extent and thickness) of the landslides before their burial and compaction.

During two research voyages, we have collected new geophysical data and sediment samples from the site of the landslides; these data are perhaps most critical to the outcomes of the project.

Second, we’re applying these new physical descriptions of landslides, along with knowledge of where they occurred, to inform computational models. The models, run using the cutting-edge fluid dynamics modeling tool Basilisk, simulate landslide motion, tsunami generation, and hazard metrics like inundation extents, wave amplitudes, wave arrival times, and current velocities.

Third, during two research voyages, we have collected new geophysical data—multibeam bathymetry, subbottom profiles, and high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiles—and sediment samples from rock dredges and sediment cores from the site of the landslides. Data from the voyages are perhaps most critical to the outcomes of the project. The modeling builds a picture of the likely impacts of the Tasman Sea landslides, but probing the sites of their origin in the real world draws tangible ties between these ancient events and the present day.

So what about the present day? During sea level highstands, when sea levels rise above the edge of a continental shelf, as is the case today, delivery of sediment to the deep ocean is thought to decrease. However, a paucity of information from the Tasman Sea region means that no one knows how much, how fast, and exactly where sediment is accumulating at present. It is not clear whether the conveyor belt of northward sediment delivery is still operating or what could trigger a future landslide event.

Setting Sail

In October 2021, on the first of the two research voyages, a small science party of five boarded the R/V Tangaroa for an 11-day voyage to map some 5,000 square kilometers of the Tasman Sea for the first time and to identify targets for a sampling campaign to be conducted during the second voyage (Figure 1). The preexisting seismic reflection data set for the region (Figure 2), comprising data gathered during numerous explorative surveys over several decades, appeared to show evidence of “megablocks” peeking up through the modern seabed from within the most recent Tasman Sea landslide deposit. These megablocks are large clasts or “rafts” of material that were transported within a landslide and that have remained mostly intact. Such blocks often form highly irregular seafloor topography in the immediate aftermath of an underwater landslide and can create localized sediment traps when normal sedimentation resumes. Heading into the voyage, it was uncertain whether these features would be visible or prominent on the seafloor or whether we could identify viable targets for sampling.

Fig. 2. Ancient landslide deposits beneath the modern seafloor are evident in this seismic reflection profile produced from data collected prior to the Silent Tsunami project.

True to form for the Tasman Sea, after leaving the shelter of Wellington Harbour, a howling southerly wind and 8-meter swells pummeled our ship during the 20-hour transit. Once on site, however, about 100 kilometers off New Zealand’s North Island, above the continental shelf break and rise, conditions calmed, allowing the ship’s multibeam echo sounders to run—and map the seafloor at high resolution—uninterrupted.

Fig. 3. Perspective views from the newly acquired bathymetric data set show shelf-slope canyons, pockmarks, and evidence of small, recent slope failures (top), as well as the tops of megablocks from the most recent ancient landslide rising above the modern seafloor of the continental rise at water depths of 1,500–1,700 meters (bottom).

As the data came in, we spent long hours poring over them in the bathymetry lab aboard the Tangaroa. The time was highly rewarding. First came images of canyons, numerous pockmarks, and evidence of recent small-scale slope failures as the ship passed over the shelf break and traversed the continental slope (Figure 3). Then we saw an astonishing area of deep seafloor littered with numerous angular, often elongated ridges and peaks up to 100 meters in relief, some with surrounding “moats” winnowed by the action of recent ocean currents. These ridges are the exposed tops of megablocks from the most recent Tasman Sea landslide, still making their mark on the seafloor roughly 1 million years later.

We decided the megablocks, now that we’d observed them firsthand, were viable targets for rock dredging, offering the tantalizing possibility of sampling landslide material itself. If we could achieve it, this sampling could allow us to characterize the sedimentology and physical properties of the landslide and thus to refine our fluid dynamics models. In addition, areas between blocks would be good targets to sample covering sediments to help constrain the minimum age of the most recent and largest landslide and to determine the rate and patterns of modern sediment accumulation.

We set off on the 3-week-long second voyage, again aboard the Tangaroa, on 15 March 2022. Taking advantage of a spell of calm weather, we deployed the ship’s brand-new 96-channel solid seismic streamer to collect reflection data, then waited anxiously for the first data. Our worry was unnecessary, as the data looked beautiful, with much-improved resolution compared with the preexisting data set.

The biggest highlights from this voyage came as we turned our attention to sediment sampling and targeted several megablocks with the rock dredge. We recovered a lot of sticky mud thought to be the “mud drape” formed by the continuous rain of fine-grained sediment that accumulates normally over many years. We also recovered fist- to paving slab–sized clasts of more consolidated mud and fine sand, which we cautiously assumed to be landslide material.

After deciding to target a flat-topped megablock at roughly 1,500 meters depth for coring, we again waited nervously to see what, if anything, we’d recover. To the team’s excitement, we indeed recovered a 4-meter core from the megablock. Does it contain landslide material, or is it all mud drape? Time will tell. Now back on dry land, we are awaiting the results of nondestructive preliminary scanning before we split and subsample the core to determine in detail what we recovered. In all, 79 meters of core were successfully recovered on the voyage, including from the areas between megablocks, which we are confident will enable us to characterize modern sediment deposition and properties.

From Data to Knowledge to Application

We expect our project to generate new knowledge that builds a picture of modern-day conditions at the site of the Tasman Sea landslides; to refine our understanding of the return rate of large, potentially tsunami-generating landslides; and to develop credible scenarios of the specific hazards related to them. Pathways to assessing the usefulness of the information gained and to guide its uptake in national hazard assessments involve working with a hazard scientists’ advisory group, territorial authorities, and civil defense agencies.

Fig. 4. This depiction of the New Zealand National Tsunami Hazard Model shows expected tsunami heights along the country’s coastline. Although formally published in 2013, the model is continually updated as more information becomes available.

The most likely conduit to implementation in New Zealand is the Review of Tsunami Hazard in New Zealand, a probabilistic risk assessment that quantitively estimates maximum tsunami heights along the country’s coastlines (Figure 4). The model underpins more detailed site-specific hazard assessments and emergency management planning and is continually refined and updated with new information. In Australia, new information from this project could be incorporated into state-based hazard assessments and education programs led by the country’s Emergency Management authorities.

An exciting prospect is the potential to apply the same approaches used in our project to other areas of New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere. Many of the world’s continental margins have been imaged using seismic reflection surveying—often during exploration for offshore energy resources—creating a vast repository of information about the subsurface. Most of what is known about tsunamis generated by underwater landslides comes from computational models, with few observed examples of such slides to validate them. But existing data sets may hold a wealth of data related to numerous examples of ancient underwater landslides now buried beneath the seafloor.

Translating knowledge from examples of subsurface landslides into information to support hazard assessment is rarely done because of a lack of information on the ages of the landslides and the complexities of assessing their size introduced by their burial, compaction, and incomplete preservation. We hope that results and learning from our early-stage research will help scientists better understand regional tsunami hazards. We also hope that these results will pave the way for future endeavors to develop constructive tools to support refined tsunami hazard assessment and emergency management planning, helping safeguard people around and beyond the Tasman Sea.

These ridges are the exposed tops of megablocks from the most recent Tasman Sea landslide, still making their mark on the seafloor roughly 1 million years later.

We decided the megablocks, now that we’d observed them firsthand, were viable targets for rock dredging, offering the tantalizing possibility of sampling landslide material itself. If we could achieve it, this sampling could allow us to characterize the sedimentology and physical properties of the landslide and thus to refine our fluid dynamics models. In addition, areas between blocks would be good targets to sample covering sediments to help constrain the minimum age of the most recent and largest landslide and to determine the rate and patterns of modern sediment accumulation.

We set off on the 3-week-long second voyage, again aboard the Tangaroa, on 15 March 2022. Taking advantage of a spell of calm weather, we deployed the ship’s brand-new 96-channel solid seismic streamer to collect reflection data, then waited anxiously for the first data. Our worry was unnecessary, as the data looked beautiful, with much-improved resolution compared with the preexisting data set.

The biggest highlights from this voyage came as we turned our attention to sediment sampling and targeted several megablocks with the rock dredge. We recovered a lot of sticky mud thought to be the “mud drape” formed by the continuous rain of fine-grained sediment that accumulates normally over many years. We also recovered fist- to paving slab–sized clasts of more consolidated mud and fine sand, which we cautiously assumed to be landslide material.

After deciding to target a flat-topped megablock at roughly 1,500 meters depth for coring, we again waited nervously to see what, if anything, we’d recover. To the team’s excitement, we indeed recovered a 4-meter core from the megablock. Does it contain landslide material, or is it all mud drape? Time will tell. Now back on dry land, we are awaiting the results of nondestructive preliminary scanning before we split and subsample the core to determine in detail what we recovered. In all, 79 meters of core were successfully recovered on the voyage, including from the areas between megablocks, which we are confident will enable us to characterize modern sediment deposition and properties.

From Data to Knowledge to Application

We expect our project to generate new knowledge that builds a picture of modern-day conditions at the site of the Tasman Sea landslides; to refine our understanding of the return rate of large, potentially tsunami-generating landslides; and to develop credible scenarios of the specific hazards related to them. Pathways to assessing the usefulness of the information gained and to guide its uptake in national hazard assessments involve working with a hazard scientists’ advisory group, territorial authorities, and civil defense agencies.

Fig. 4. This depiction of the New Zealand National Tsunami Hazard Model shows expected tsunami heights along the country’s coastline. Although formally published in 2013, the model is continually updated as more information becomes available.

The most likely conduit to implementation in New Zealand is the Review of Tsunami Hazard in New Zealand, a probabilistic risk assessment that quantitively estimates maximum tsunami heights along the country’s coastlines (Figure 4). The model underpins more detailed site-specific hazard assessments and emergency management planning and is continually refined and updated with new information. In Australia, new information from this project could be incorporated into state-based hazard assessments and education programs led by the country’s Emergency Management authorities.

An exciting prospect is the potential to apply the same approaches used in our project to other areas of New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere. Many of the world’s continental margins have been imaged using seismic reflection surveying—often during exploration for offshore energy resources—creating a vast repository of information about the subsurface. Most of what is known about tsunamis generated by underwater landslides comes from computational models, with few observed examples of such slides to validate them. But existing data sets may hold a wealth of data related to numerous examples of ancient underwater landslides now buried beneath the seafloor.

Translating knowledge from examples of subsurface landslides into information to support hazard assessment is rarely done because of a lack of information on the ages of the landslides and the complexities of assessing their size introduced by their burial, compaction, and incomplete preservation. We hope that results and learning from our early-stage research will help scientists better understand regional tsunami hazards. We also hope that these results will pave the way for future endeavors to develop constructive tools to support refined tsunami hazard assessment and emergency management planning, helping safeguard people around and beyond the Tasman Sea.

BEIJING -- Heavy rain in China has claimed six lives this week and forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people.

Five people died in southeastern China, according to state media reports: A house collapse took three lives in Fujian province on Tuesday, and two died Monday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in neighboring Jiangxi province.

One person died and three are missing in northern China after a vehicle fell into the water in mountain flooding from heavy rain in the Inner Mongolia region.

China regularly experiences seasonal rains and flooding during the summer, most frequently in central and southern areas.

Video on state broadcaster CCTV showed large parts of cities flooded in muddy waters. Rescue workers carried trapped people out of buildings on their backs in waist-deep water in Guangdong province, also in the southeast.

The rain ended Wednesday in Jiangxi, but more precipitation is forecast for another week in Fujian, Jiangxi and Guangdong and the nearby Guangxi region. The National Meteorological Center said residents should prepare for floods and landslides as the soil is already saturated in those areas.

More than 110,000 people have been relocated in Jiangxi province, along with more than 80,000 in Fujian, state media reports said.

Guwahati:

Fresh landslides were reported from various parts of Guwahati on Wednesday, amid incessant rainfall, which also led to heavy flooding in most parts of the city, officials said.

During the day there were no reports of new casualties.

The state has recorded 42 deaths this year from flooding and landslides, including four that were buried under a massive mound of earth in the Boragaon area on Tuesday.

An official of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told PTI that accumulation of debris caused by landslides has blocked passageways in the Geetanagar, Sonapur, Kalapahar and Nijarapar areas.

Heavy rainfall has also flooded roads in several parts of the city – the worst affected among them are Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Rajgarh Link Road, Rukminigaon, Hatigaon and Krishna Nagar.

NDRF and SDRF personnel, deployed in these areas, are using boats to rescue people and offer relief supplies to those still trapped in flooded homes, the official said.

Assam Power Distribution Company Limited (APDCL) is working around the clock to restore power in the city, which has been in darkness since Tuesday, while drinking water tankers have been sent to the flooded areas.

The Kamrup Metropolitan district administration has urged people to leave their homes only if they have urgent or essential work.

Kamrup Metropolitan Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha has issued an order ordering all schools, colleges and educational institutions to suspend classes in the wake of a rain alert issued by the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC).

The RMC issued a ‘red alert’ for Assam and Meghalaya and forecast isolated and scattered ‘extremely heavy rain’ from Tuesday to Thursday, and ‘orange alert’ for Friday and Saturday.

A bulletin issued by the ASDMA said the flooding situation in several parts of the state is grim, with eight districts being inundated by rising waters in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries.

Dima Hasao Deputy Commissioner Nazreen Ahmed has issued an advisory asking people to restrict movement in public places.

The consultancy has urged people in vulnerable locations to go to the nearest notified shelters.

Nazreen Ahmed has issued another order ordering all educational institutions to remain closed until May 17, an official release said.

Silchar: Over 10 houses have been destroyed and many others partially damaged due to rainfall-induced landslides in several villages under the Nilambazar revenue circle in southern Assam’s Karimganj district over the past three days.

According to sources, heavy rainfall-triggered landslides and storm have razed and damaged the houses in several areas, including Dholcherra, Angura, Fatehpur and Pathu.

Many have reportedly sustained injuries after the houses were damaged in the landslides, however, no casualty has been reported so far.

Besides, rains have also disrupted surface communication in several places, including Fakirabazar-Nilambazar, Kaliganj-Khagail, Manthali-Longai and Baropunji-Basbari roads.

On Sunday, officials of Nilambazar circle office conducted an inspection in the landslide-affected areas to take stock of the situation. After the inspection, the officials distributed tents among people whose houses have been razed due to landslides, the sources said.

A team comprising Pathu GP president Manik Das, Dholcherra GP president Liyakat Ali and Fatehpur GP president Hossain Ahmed among others met the affected families on Sunday to know about their condition and assured them of all possible assistance. They also appealed to the authorities concerned to take appropriate steps and provide adequate compensation to people who have suffered losses.

PWD official Aniruddha Nag said that connectivity on several roads, which fall under the purview of the PWD Nilambazar (rural roads division), had been affected due to heavy rainfall and landslides. Necessary steps are being taken to restore the connectivity at the earliest, Nag said.

Nilambazar circle officer Sajjad Hossain said officials had been sent to the affected areas to assess the damage or loss caused by the natural disaster. A report will be submitted to the Karimganj Deputy Commissioner regarding compensation to be provided to the affected families, Hossain said.

Karimganj South MLA Siddeque Ahmed told EastMojo that he had spoken to the Nilambazar circle officer about the matter and directed him to inspect the affected areas. An inspection had been done to assess the damages, Ahmed said.

Siddeque said that compensation would be provided to people who have suffered losses due to the disaster. However, Karimganj North Congress MLA Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha could not be reached for his comments.

A weather bulletin issued by the Regional Meteorological Centre, Guwahati on Sunday stated that Karimganj district would witness rainfall and thundershowers at least till Thursday.

Another 76 300 ha (187 8000 acres) of crops were damaged in neighboring Jiangxi.

Heavy rains, floods and landslides affecting Hunan this month claimed the lives of 10 people while three remain missing, as of June 8.1 In addition, at least 8 people were killed in Fujian, 5 in Yunan, and 2 in Guanxi since the start of the flood season.

286 000 people were evacuated in Hunan and a total of 1.79 million were affected this month.

More than 2 700 houses have collapsed or suffered severe damage and 96 160 ha (237 616 acres) of crops have been destroyed in the province – a major rice-producing region in China.

Direct economic losses are estimated at more than 4 billion yuan ($600 million).

The heavy rain has affected almost the whole province, with some rainfall monitoring stations registering precipitation at historic levels.

In neighboring Jiangxi, another 800 000 people were affected since May 28.2

The rainfall wreaked havoc in the province’s 80 counties, damaged 76 300 ha (187 8000 acres) of crops, and caused direct economic losses of 1.16 billion yuan (about 174 million U.S. dollars), according to the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters.

Many villagers from Ganzhou City have been evacuated after heavy rains triggered floods on June 6, CCTV reported.

Downpours battered the Ganxian District of the city from 03:00 to 09:00 UTC on June 6, with the accumulated rainfall reaching 265 mm (10.43 inches), inundating croplands and roads.

The Logistics Sector in India is undoubtedly playing the most significant role in any sector’s supply chain. Whatever the industry, be it hospitality, manufacturing or healthcare industries, transportation companies play a key role in connecting the organizations to their clients.

The Global Logistics Sector is estimated to be soon worth 300 Billion USD. [**Transportation services in India**](https://www.equitylogistic.com/) alone, around 10% to 15% of product costs may be attributed to the logistics sector. This is comparatively significant from other economies like that of China, the UK or the USA. We can say that our Indian Logistics sector is one of the fast-evolving industries. However, we can say that this exponential growth is not without challenges and is variable. Let us take a look at a few challenges that are endured by the Transportation Companies in our country. They are:

**1. Transportation Challenges**

The primary mode of [**Transportation in Andaman and Nicobar island**](https://www.equitylogistic.com/transportation-services-to-andaman-and-nicobar-islands.php) is transportation by road. Nearly 60% of cargo moves by road. A mere 32% of cargo moves by rail owing to over-saturated rail networks and high rail tariffs. It is not without a fair amount of hiccups, although the majority of the supply chain moves by road. Because of poor road infrastructure, multiple checkpoints, and congestion, Road transportation proves to be quite inefficient.

**2. Bulk Order Intensity Ratio**

One of the most herculean tasks for transportation companies is keeping up with bulk order timelines. Every Indian Transportation Company in the Logistic Sector in the event of receiving a bulk load of orders has faced the exhausting issue of keeping up with the supply-chain timeline. In the instance of the high volume of orders received, it often gets difficult on an extremely tight timeline to prioritize and juggle orders and deliveries. When the [**Transportation services to Andaman and Nicobar islands**](https://www.equitylogistic.com/transportation-services-to-andaman-and-nicobar-islands.php) have limited resources, owing to the difficult payment cycles this challenge gets aggravated. Festival time is the best example of mass delays in delivery schedules when an overall failure of the ETA mechanism can be observed.

**3. Hike In Fuel Cost**

One of the biggest challenges faced by the transportation companies in the Indian logistic sector is the cost of fuel. The inflation in fuel prices results in an increase in transportation costs to the shippers. And what constantly increase the surcharges added to freight rates is a rise in fuel prices. This naturally cuts down the earnings and revenue of truckers, as fuel prices increase.

**4. Unforeseen Delays in Transportation**

The varied terrain and diverse travel and weather conditions in India, create unreliability in the transportation industry, owing to the high probability of unforeseen conditions. The transportation industry is often challenged by delays, even when the packaging and drops are conducted on schedule. Covering different terrains, subject to different conditions mainly because India is a huge country. Another thing is the remote, which are prone to accidents and landslides, mostly the internal parts of the country and Ghats roads are terrible.

The multiple checkpoints, toll stations and traffic congestions add to the woes. Losing out on a lot of time and money translates into the [**Transportation services to Lakshadweep island**](https://www.equitylogistic.com/transportation-services-to-lakshadweep-island.php)**.** Even after taking into consideration extra delays, more unforeseen delays cannot be ruled out in a nutshell.

**5. Dearth of Skilled Personnel**

Today, an alarming lack of skilled manpower and specialized personnel is faced by the Indian Logistics sector. There is a keen requirement for technically skilled labour with the advent of modern technology. However, to make the process efficient the labourers are under-skilled, over-worked and lack the desired skill-set. Also, **transportation services in India** compromise on the training and payment of their logistics staff to save on capital. Resultantly, these companies face the problem of increased training costs, under-performing human resource, and high labour turnover.

**6. Pitiable Warehousing Conditions**

Another major challenge is storage. In India, the unfortunate plight of pitiable warehousing facilities in **Transportation in Andaman and Nicobar island** is no secret. Cargos incur immense damage owing to damage due to leakages, lack of proper storage space, pest-infested warehouses, and much more. In the case of low margin goods and cargo, this is most predominant. Also, just because the Governments use the big warehouses to store grains, this often leaves very little space for cargo storage.

**7. Inadequate and Overstressed Delivery Staff**

A grave challenge faced by the supply chain of the Indian logistic sector overstressed delivery staff. Employing and retaining their delivery staff is the most faced problem of all the [**Transportation services in India**](https://www.equitylogistic.com/). Leading to the workloads of multiple time-bound deliveries being placed on the current workers, the industry faces a shortage of delivery personnel.

Heavy floods and landslides triggered by pre-monsoon rains in India’s northeastern state of Assam have killed at least 10 people and affected more than 700,000, authorities said Thursday.

One of the world’s largest rivers, the Brahmaputra, which flows into India and neighboring Bangladesh from Tibet, burst its banks in Assam over the past three days, inundating more than 1,900 villages.

Torrential rains lashed most of the rugged state, and the downpour continued on Wednesday, with more forecast over the next two days.

“The flood situation is turning critical by the hour,” Assam’s water resources minister, Pijush Hazarika, told Reuters, adding that seven people had drowned in separate incidents during the past three days.

Soldiers of the Indian army retrieved more than 2,000 people trapped in the district of Hojai in a rescue effort that continues, according to the state’s health minister, Keshab Mahanta.

Water levels in the Brahmaputra were expected to rise further, national authorities said.

“The situation remains extremely grave in the worst-hit Dima Hasao district, with both rail and road links snapped due to flooding and landslides,” said Assam’s revenue minister, Jogen Mohan, who is overseeing relief efforts there.

Meanwhile, cities elsewhere in India, notably the capital, New Delhi, are broiling in a heat wave that has engulfed much of South Asia.

Soaring temperatures in parts of Pakistan and India in recent weeks have forced schools to close, damaged crops, put pressure on energy supplies and kept residents indoors. It even prompted experts to question whether such heat is fit for human survival.

“The flood situation is turning critical by the hour,” Assam’s water resources minister, Pijush Hazarika, told Reuters, adding that seven people had drowned in separate incidents during the past three days.

Soldiers of the Indian army retrieved more than 2,000 people trapped in the district of Hojai in a rescue effort that continues, according to the state’s health minister, Keshab Mahanta.

Water levels in the Brahmaputra were expected to rise further, national authorities said.

“The situation remains extremely grave in the worst-hit Dima Hasao district, with both rail and road links snapped due to flooding and landslides,” said Assam’s revenue minister, Jogen Mohan, who is overseeing relief efforts there.

Meanwhile, cities elsewhere in India, notably the capital, New Delhi, are broiling in a heat wave that has engulfed much of South Asia.

Soaring temperatures in parts of Pakistan and India in recent weeks have forced schools to close, damaged crops, put pressure on energy supplies and kept residents indoors. It even prompted experts to question whether such heat is fit for human survival.

Comment below ⬇️,https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-landslide-and-what-causes-one,1652909051.0,landslides,"What is a landslide and what causes one?
A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of ""mass wasting,"" which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The term ""landslide"" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. These are further subdivided by the type of geologic material (bedrock, debris, or earth). Debris flows (commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of common landslide types.

Almost every landslide has multiple causes. Slope movement occurs when forces acting down-slope (mainly due to gravity) exceed the strength of the earth materials that compose the slope. Causes include factors that increase the effects of down-slope forces and factors that contribute to low or reduced strength. Landslides can be initiated in slopes already on the verge of movement by rainfall, snowmelt, changes in water level, stream erosion, changes in ground water, earthquakes, volcanic activity, disturbance by human activities, or any combination of these factors. Earthquake shaking and other factors can also induce landslides underwater. These landslides are called submarine landslides. Submarine landslides sometimes cause tsunamis that damage coastal areas.

&gt; In the remote state of Assam, 31 of its 33 districts have been affected by floods, impacting the lives of more than 700,000 people, officials said on Saturday.

&gt; At least 18 people have already died in the state because of floods and landslides, according to news reports.

&gt; About two million people have been affected in the Sylhet region, in the country&amp;#039;s east, in what officials describe as one of the worst floods in many years.

&gt; At least 10 people have been killed in the region, most drowning after their boats capsized while they were trying to move to safer areas, officials said on Sunday.

&gt; At least 3,000 hectares of rice paddy fields have been consumed by the flooding, which is expected to affect the livelihoods of thousands of farmers, officials said.

May 22, 2022, 7:04 a.m. ET.NEW DELHI - Heavy pre-monsoon rains in India and Bangladesh have washed away train stations, towns and villages, leaving millions of people homeless as extreme weather events, including heat waves, intense rainfall and floods, become more common in South Asia.More than 60 people have been killed in days of flooding, landslides and thunderstorms that have left many people without food and drinking water and have isolated them by cutting off the internet, according to officials.

In the remote state of Assam, 31 of its 33 districts have been affected by floods, impacting the lives of more than 700,000 people, officials said on Saturday.

At least 18 people have already died in the state because of floods and landslides, according to news reports.

About two million people have been affected in the Sylhet region, in the country's east, in what officials describe as one of the worst floods in many years.

At least 10 people have been killed in the region, most drowning after their boats capsized while they were trying to move to safer areas, officials said on Sunday.

At least 3,000 hectares of rice paddy fields have been consumed by the flooding, which is expected to affect the livelihoods of thousands of farmers, officials said.

IPOH: A family of five who just moved into their new home in Taman Sri Perkasa here two days ago were horrified when the perimeter wall of their home collapsed during a landslide.

Freelance insurance agent Dina Liz Ismail, 37, said part of the slope next to their house on Laluan Lapangan 3 gave way during a thunderstorm just before dawn on Sunday (May 15).

""There was a blackout at about 5am, and we could see muddy water flowing on the road in front of our house and down the slope.

""At about 6am, the perimeter wall started to crack and then collapsed along with part of the slope,"" she said.

""It was a scary moment for us as this was totally unexpected,"" she added.

Dina Liz said the structure of the house had been checked by the developer and was found to be still stable.

""The developer said it would repair the damage and put us up at a nearby homestay,"" she said, adding that the repairs could take about two weeks.

A Fire and Rescue Department spokesman said they received a call about the incident at about 7am.

""Shortly after we arrived, we inspected the location to ensure that no one was hurt.

""We advised the affected house owner and two other residents living near the landslide to vacate their homes for now,"" he said.

Residents' association chairman Datuk Zul Zukree Zakaria said he believed that the landslide was caused by a nearby development project.

""Since the project started about two years ago, there have been numerous flash floods here.

""This time, part of the slope collapsed,"" he said.

""We hope the Ipoh City Council will (view) this matter seriously and take action before more incidents happen,"" he added.

Former lecturer Noah Wong, who has been living in the area for almost a decade, said the roads outside their houses often flooded when it rains heavily.

""It has become worse over the past year and it's just a matter of time before the water enters our houses,"" the 57-year-old said.

Meanwhile, Gopeng MCA vice chairman Cally Ting said she would try to find a solution to the constant flash floods there.

""We will meet with all the relevant parties, including the developer of the project and the mayor.

""Some 106 residents have collected signatures to be passed to the mayor asking him to look into the issues here.

""We all want to find out the main cause of the flash floods and resolve it,"" she said.

Former Ipoh city councillor Kok Pak Foo said there had been two landslides along the road in the area.

""I believe the drainage system can no longer accommodate the amount of water that flows through, especially when it rains heavily.

""A lot of new houses are also being built nearby,"" said Kok, who is also a Gopeng MCA vice-chairman.

Ipoh Timur MP Wong Kah Woh said the pre-dawn downpour and thunderstorm caused several areas in his constituency to be flooded.

He said these included Kampung Seri Kinta, Kampung Pasir Puteh and Taman Pengkalan Harapan, with more than 50 houses affected.

""We urge the city council to find the root cause of the flooding.

The [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation](https://mumbailive.com/en/tag/brihanmumbai-municipal-corporation) ([BMC](https://mumbailive.com/en/tag/bmc)) has decided to train people living in landslide-prone areas in Mumbai from May 20.

This development comes amid a rising threat of landslides in the city and interior parts of the neighbouring cities such as MMR.

As per BMC’s survey this year, 72 locations fall under highly vulnerable category.

Meanwhile on priority basis, civic body will start training in the most vulnerable locations in [Bhandup](https://mumbailive.com/en/tag/bhandup), Powai, [Vikhroli](https://mumbailive.com/en/tag/vikhroli), and [Ghatkopar](https://mumbailive.com/en/tag/ghatkopar) in the city.

In addition, with the help of NGOs, BMC will also distribute a disaster management kit to all the residents in the highly vulnerable locations— a torch, whistle, waterproof bag to keep important papers and jewellery in, biscuit, and a water pouch. The team will also give does/don’ts during landslides.

It plans to cover all the 72 landslide prone areas before monsoon begins.

According to reports, over 50 people have lost their lives in landslides in the past three years in Mumbai. Of the total, 29 died in two separate incidents at Vikhroli and Chembur last year alone.

Who will be trained?

Trainers will visit the sites, talk to the youth, and give out basic information about the programme and its need among the locals. It will then select ten volunteers to train from each community.

As per the module, their training will include rescue operation, crowd control, casualty-carrying method, how to contact and direct authorities to the site, first aid, and carrying the disabled and elderly.

The civic body is also preparing a database of all the elderly and disabled living in the [landslide-prone areas](https://mumlive.co/aiRTwjb) and may require additional help. The trained volunteers will be provided with the list.

Additionally, a team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) with its state headquarters in Pune will be positioned in these vulnerable spots. Ahead of the monsoon, in coordination with the locals, they will also survey the area.

Because of wintry weather conditions, the recovery operation will be delayed, the release states.

It was just after midnight when we got set upon.  We were making up for lost time after routing around a rockslide that collapsed the wider path.  We’d never seen any of them this far East. Hell, we were still a week away from the contested areas, and no message had made it to us that anything was different. We had some pressure on the outskirts these last few months but there was nothing like this. When we heard the horn, we all turned like good, ready warriors and readied to end the lives of any who would come against us.  Then we heard the footsteps.  Then we felt the footsteps. After the line split down the middle from the first wave, we heard the call to retreat.  It all went to hell so fast.  Not even a minute before we had no idea they were even there.  Now half my clan lied dead in the mud as we started falling back, down the mountainside.  The bastards were everywhere.  We would cut one down, but two would swarm in behind before their blood even hit the ground.  They were savage and undisciplined, but they just had the numbers.  I couldn’t tell you if they were in the hundreds, but they felt like it.  My mount took a spear in the hindquarters and buckled.  I’ve never hit the ground so hard in my life.  Damn near felt like my spine would snap as Ebben rolled onto, and then over me.  I didn’t see it, but I heard him hit the trees behind me.  He got a terrified scream out before another hard hit cut it short. After that I just heard his weight rolling down the mountainside.  

I went into a tree myself.  It kept me from spilling down a steep embankment, but it cost me a few ribs and the ability to breath for what felt like an eternity, but was only probably ten seconds or so.  The only reason I am alive is that they got to me before I could get back to my feat.  The tree had actually saved me twice over.  Yet here I was now, face down with a knee into my freshly broken ribs, and that air air was gone again.  Even through the tunnel vision, I could hear and feel the metal getting closed around my wrists, and even though I felt like I was about to die, I knew I wouldn’t, but that I would awaken enslaved.  They had shackles.  Shackles aren’t rope.  They aren’t multi-purpose.  They have a singular purpose, and that was my final lamenting thought as the tunnel of darkness closed in on me.  My head got weak, and fell into the mud.  The last sensation I can remember is the taste of blood and dirt in total, silent darkness.  

When I awoke, I couldn’t move.  I was in a pile of my brethren.  The weight on me was heavier than anything I can remember.  Every damn breath felt like Ebben being rolled over again and again.  I was the only one awake.  Everyone else pressed against me was warm but the one on my back.  He felt cold, and his body never moved.  He had voided himself onto me during the night when he passed, but it had likely been long before I awoken, as not only was he, but also his soil cold upon me.  Someone shifted as they came out of their own unconscious, and I slid a bit lower.  After what was probably 3 hours, I finally could take a breath.  The second my face pressed against the wood of the cart I was in, I took an excruciating deep breath of air and passed out.  

The next time I woke up I went from a dark and dreamy haze to the most shockingly violent wave of pure cold crashed over me and I was suddenly awake in water.  My lungs were so tired.  Every breath felt like fire in the night, and now all I wanted to do was breath.  Gods, all I wanted was air.   All I could see was a blurry light, but that was all I had so I swam to it.  There are moments that humble dwarves.  Drowning in what is waist high water for everyone else is the event that does it more than you’d think for our people.  All I could hear was them laughing when my ears breached the water, and the stifling quiet of water that felt like it came from a glacier.  I could sink to the bottom and with a slight jump I could break the water and take a quick breath.  I didn’t think to exhale on the way up the first time, so when I broke the surface all I could get was a mouthful of water when I tried to breathe in and went under after having fully exhaled.  My body convulsed to get back to the surface, and my leg happened to kick hard enough against the bottom to get me into the realm of air.  My broken ribs rake across each other as I took in that breathe and went back under.  Breathing was pain, not breathing was pain, the water was painfully cold. Everything was pain.  That’s all there was.  In every incarnation.  

I felt one grab a handful of my hair, all the way down to the scalp and then yank.  Most of the hair held, quite a bit didn’t.  Fine shale sheered along my right side as he drug me onto the bank, then I watched as they grabbed another of my men from the wagon and heave him into the five foot deep center of the water that did indeed seem to flow down from the glacier atop the Marrowdwell Mountains above.  I couldn’t’ recognize him before they threw him.  We were all covered in mud, blood, sweat, vomit, piss and shit before we were cast into the dispelling freeze, and came out surprisingly cleared up of all the filth.  

I think it pissed them off when we all rose to our feet, shattered, ragged, but still standing proud.  Never have I been more proud of my men.  There was no order from me, and no command from the orcs.  They simply rose, even then.  Because that’s what they do.  Hurrik, Lembrun, and Hassal.  I’m still trying to find them.  They came up to me and unfastened my shackles from behind me and when they saw my eyes begin looking around I saw the knives at my men’s throats.  There was nothing in their eyes.  Nothing.

ST. GEORGE — The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway, which runs through the heart of Zion National Park, has reopened, following a rockfall described as “significant” by park officials.

Update June 1, 7:40 p.m. Adds re-opening of Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway.

According to a National Park Service news release posted at 7:38 p.m.:

The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway is open after Zion National Park staff cleared a rockfall west of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel. After initially clearing the road, National Park Service (NPS) staff observed other loose rocks above the right of way. NPS staff used water pumped from a fire truck to dislodge these rocks.

The rockfall, which occurred west of the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel shortly before 2 p.m., had forced the closure of state Route 9 from the Canyon Junction Bridge to the East Entrance of the park. The length includes much of the area that is usually only accessible to the park’s shuttles as well as the Zion-Mount Carmel Tunnel.

“There was a rockfall on the highway, Jonathan Shafer, a spokesperson with Zion National Park, told St. George News. “Maintenance crews are going up to address it right now.”

Shafer added that to his understanding, there have been no injuries or property damage connected to the rockslide.

A news release issued by the National Park Service shortly before 4 p.m. Wednesday confirmed the rockfall did not damage any vehicles or cause any injuries. It also did not affect the road to Zion Canyon.

Visitors were still able to access Zion Canyon using the park’s shuttle system, the news release said. Shuttles leave from the park’s South Entrance at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center in Springdale. Visitors traveling from east of Zion were directed to follow alternate routes to arrive at the park’s South Entrance.

The road in Zion is commonly a site that sees landslides from the continually changing landscape of the park, including one last year and another in 2019

Visitors to Yellowstone National Park were seen narrowly escaping with their lives after a rockslide began falling on their vehicle amid devastating floods.

The drama took place when heavy rain fell on northern Wyoming and southern Montana on Sunday, causing record-breaking flooding into Monday and Tuesday.

A video shared to social media by Twitter user Anne Leopold showed one SUV approaching a turn on a road while rock slabs fell from the slope above.

Pieces of rock smashed and broke around the SUV, which Ms Leopold said had occupants inside who “seemed okay” despite some rock appearing to strike the vehicle.

Both the SUV and the Twitter user, who was filming the drive out of Yellowstone, had been heading towards the northern gate by Gardiner -- a Montana town badly affected by the water levels.

Only one road out of the tourist town remains open, according to Mike Skelton, the president of the local chamber of commerce.

He told KULR-8 news on Wednesday: “As you know being down here, there were several thousand visitors that were stuck here in Gardiner and couldn’t get out through the park, couldn’t get out through Highway 89”.

Roughly 10,000 people have been evacuated from Yellowstone since Sunday as floodwaters submerged critical bits of infrastructure and popular trails. Only a group of campers remains, officials said.

Residents of neighbouring towns have meanwhile taken-in thousands of visitors and power supplies continue to be affected, as does drinking water. A number of homes and buildings have also been damaged but no fatalities have been reported.

Some 87 people have been rescued by the Montana National Guard following the declaration of a disaster by state governor Greg Gianforte, the agency said on Wednesday.

Water levels in some parts are falling but according to the National Weather Service in Billings, Montana, the flood remains at the highest warning level, of 16ft.

UPDATE: June 18

Yellowstone National Park’s south loop will reopen to the public on June 22

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about the new interim visitor entry system



At 8 a.m. Wednesday, June 22, Yellowstone National Park will begin allowing visitors to access the south loop of the park. The south loop is accessed from the East (Cody), West (West Yellowstone), and South (Grand Teton/Jackson) entrances. Accessible areas include Madison, Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village and Norris. As part of reopening planning, park staff have engaged over 1,000 business owners, park partners, commercial operators and residents in surrounding gateway communities to determine how to manage summer visitation while the north loop remains closed due to flood damage.



To balance the demand for visitor access, park resource protection and economic interests of the communities, the park will institute an interim visitor access plan. The interim plan, referred to as the Alternating License Plate System (ALPS), was suggested as a solution by gateway communities during major public engagement with the park this past week. Park managers and partners have agreed this system is the best interim solution to ensuring the south loop does not become overwhelmed by visitors. The National Park Service will actively monitor the license plate system and is concurrently building a new reservation system that will be ready for implementation if needed.

Alternating License Plate System (ALPS)

Public vehicle entry will be allowed based on whether the last numerical digit on a license plate is odd or even.

Entrance will be granted based on odd/even days on the calendar. Odd-numbered last digits on license plates can enter on odd days of the month. Even-numbered last digits (including zero) on license plates can enter on even days of the month.

Personalized plates (all letters, for example ""YLWSTNE"") will fall into the “odd” category for entrance purposes.

Plates with a mix of letters and numbers but that end with a letter (for example ""YELL4EVR"") will still use the last numerical digit on the plate to determine entrance days.

Entrance station staff will turn away vehicles attempting to enter the park when the odd/even numerical digits do not correspond to the odd/even calendar date for entrance.

Exceptions

Current commercial use operators with active commercial use permits will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes commercial tours and stock groups.

Visitors with proof of overnight reservations in the park will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number. This includes hotels, campgrounds, and backcountry reservations.

Commercial motorcoaches will be permitted to enter regardless of license plate number.

Motorcycle groups may enter on even dates only.

Essential services like mail and deliver, employees and contractors may enter regardless of license plate number.

The interim license plate system will ensure that visitors have access to the park during this period of high demand. Park managers and staff will monitor the license plate system and impacts on resources, infrastructure, operations, and staffing, and may adjust or implement a reservation or timed entry system, if necessary, after three to four weeks.



“Less than six days ago, Yellowstone National Park was hit with devastating floods,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our teams and partners, we are prepared to reopen the south loop of Yellowstone. It is impossible to reopen only one loop in the summer without implementing some type of system to manage visitation. My thanks to our gateway partners and others for helping us work out an acceptable temporary solution for the south loop while we continue our efforts to reopen the north loop. As we go through the reopening process, we will monitor the system’s effectiveness and work together to make adjustments that may be necessary. We will also reopen new sections of the park as repairs continue to be made. It is critical for visitors to stay informed about this interim system as we evaluate its effectiveness. They should plan ahead and be patient with us as we are still managing significant recovery while moving into this operational phase.”

OPEN in the south loop as of June 22

CLOSED until further notice in the south loop



Visit Operating Hours and Seasons for details about what is OPEN and CLOSED throughout the park.



Yellowstone staff are working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened prior to roads closing Nov. 1. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of park managers to safely open additional sections as the year progresses. Park managers are evaluating plans to reopen roads connecting Canyon Village, Tower Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris; however, this will not happen initially. The park is also working to reconnect Mammoth Hot Springs to Gardiner and Cooke City/Silver Gate as soon as possible with temporary solutions, while long-term reconstruction is planned.



Visitors should continue to monitor the park website and for additional updates.

UPDATE: June 17

Yellowstone National Park continues efforts to recover from historic flooding; Limited reopening highly possible next week on park’s south loop with certain visitor entrance modifications

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, changes in visitor entry requirements, and road and weather conditions

Key Information

Yellowstone continues major flood recovery efforts in the north while repairing damage and preparing for reopening in the south.

All five park entrances remain closed temporarily, however, West, South, and East entrances are targeted for reopening as early as next week.

Water levels remain high but have gone down substantially over the past 24 hours.

Weather patterns and potential for additional flooding events are being monitored with the assistance of NOAA and USGS personnel.

The National Park Service (NPS) has engaged over 1,000 partners in surrounding gateway communities, counties and states in the past 96 hours to brief on flood damage impacts and collaborate on reopening strategies.

Teams are in the park assessing damage and assisting with short and long-term recovery planning.

NPS is analyzing the carrying capacity of the south loop and working closely with partners to develop appropriate visitor management actions to safely accommodate visitors within that portion of the park.

NPS is working to determine what other potential sections of the park may be reopened for the season. Decisions will depend on extent of damage and the ability of the NPS to safely open additional sections as the year progresses.

Although access to Yellowstone National Park will be less than normal until further notice, there are still incredible opportunities for recreation, wildlife viewing, and great experiences in the park’s gateway communities (Gardiner, Montana; Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana; West Yellowstone, Montana; Cody, Wyoming; and Jackson, Wyoming), as well as surrounding areas in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. View a list of nearby cities, parks, public lands, and museums to help plan your visit.

Visitors who have trips planned should continue to check the Yellowstone website, local chambers of commerce, and social media for updates to get the most up-to-date information.

Because initial damage assessments are ongoing, the NPS does not yet have an estimate on when Yellowstone will fully reopen nor are preliminary costs for repairs and recovery available.

To date, there have been no public or employee injuries reported due to the flood.

Message from the Superintendent

“We have made tremendous progress in a very short amount of time but have long way to go,” said Superintendent Cam Sholly. “All emergency and life safety objectives within the park have been accomplished or stabilized within the first 96 hours of the flood event, without major injury or death. We have an aggressive plan for recovery in the north and resumption of operations in the south. We appreciate the tremendous support from National Park Service and Department of the Interior leadership, in addition to our surrounding Congressional delegations, governors, counties, communities, and other partners. This first 96 hours has been critical to be able to focus on our life safety objectives and stabilizing emergency conditions while preparing plans for recovery.”

Objectives

North Loop (Primary Flood Recovery Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, community residents and partners Restore and maintain basic services including, power, water, and wastewater Restore temporary and permanent access between Yellowstone and Gardiner Restore temporary and permanent road access through the Northeast Entrance Road Restore access to the Yellowstone backcountry Engage communities, local, state, and federal stakeholders, and media

South Loop (Operations Zone)

Ensure safety of employees, visitors, and partners Repair damaged sections of roads and infrastructure in preparation of limited south loop reopening; inspect critical infrastructure (bridges, wastewater systems) Conduct extensive community outreach with gateways to identify and determine visitor use management actions necessary to host visitation on the south loop Develop reservation/timed entry system options for implementation with NPS visitor use experts Ensure internal business partners are prepared for visitor operations in the south loop Develop appropriate communications strategy on opening of south loop

General Updates

North Loop (Flood Recovery Zone)

All employees continue to be safe and accounted for. Additional support programs are being established for employees impacted by the flood event.

Employees who lost housing have been relocated to new housing units.

Thanks to Montana Department of Transportation and Park County Montana, Highway 89 north from Gardiner was reopened on Wednesday to facilitate the exit of stranded visitors.

Food and water supplies to Gardiner have resumed.

Power has been restored to Yellowstone with the assistance of Northwestern Energy.

Destroyed wastewater lines in Mammoth have been temporarily repaired with permanent repair options being planned.

Extensive efforts have been made to improve the Old Gardiner Road to help facilitate connection of essential services and personnel from Mammoth to Gardiner. Park staff are assessing what level of improvements are needed to facilitate higher traffic levels.

Plans and assessments of reconstruction of new the permanent road between Mammoth and Gardiner are underway. The new road will likely not be reconstructed in the same corridor as the previous road.

Teams from Federal Highways and other agencies are in the park assisting with damage assessments and assisting the park in developing cost estimates and timeline for repair.

Aerial 3D imaging flights have been conducted on the Northeast Entrance Road to Cooke City to help with damage assessments.

Extensive assessments are occurring of damage to trails, bridges and infrastructure within the Yellowstone backcountry.

Mud and rockslides have been cleared from Dunraven Pass and other sections of the northern and southern loops.

South Loop (Operations Zone)

The park intends to reopen the south loop sometime next week with new visitor management measures instituted (more information will be released soon). Reopening is dependent on damaged infrastructure being repaired.

On Thursday morning, June 16, a section of damaged road collapsed south of Canyon Village. Crews will begin major repairs on Friday, June 17 with an intent to complete repairs by Monday, June 20. This repair must be completed prior to opening the south loop.

Park staff are inspecting all bridges and roadways for damage on the south loop to facilitate safe travel.

To ensure the southern loop infrastructure is not overwhelmed, the park is working with gateway communities and NPS visitor use experts to determine the best way to facilitate access.

Known Damage and Issues

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13 by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to several park roads including: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide in Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction is compromised and collapsed overnight on June 15-16. Repairs are underway.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct or relocate and build.

In some cases, roads may not be able to be reconstructed in place and will need to be relocated.

The NPS will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible.

UPDATE: June 14

Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

Updates

Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13, by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to multiple sections of road between the North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana), Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Cooke City, Montana, near the Northeast Entrance.

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.

The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.

To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.

There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.

The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend (June 19).

Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.

At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.

Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.

Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

Known damage and issues

Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation

The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.

Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.

Statement from superintendent Cam Sholly about all entrances in Yellowstone National Park CLOSED temporarily due to heavy flooding, rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions

“Due to record flooding events in the park and more precipitation in the forecast, we have made the decision to close Yellowstone to all inbound visitation,"" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. ""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues. The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas. Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners. We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we're able to assess the damage throughout the park. It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time. I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event. We appreciate the support offered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.""

Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.

The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.

To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.

There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.

The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend (June 19).

Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.

At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.

Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.

Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

Known damage and issues

Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation

The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.

Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.

Statement from superintendent Cam Sholly about all entrances in Yellowstone National Park CLOSED temporarily due to heavy flooding, rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions

“Due to record flooding events in the park and more precipitation in the forecast, we have made the decision to close Yellowstone to all inbound visitation,"" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. ""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues. The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas. Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners. We will not know timing of the park’s reopening until flood waters subside and we're able to assess the damage throughout the park. It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time. I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event. We appreciate the support offered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.""

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park CLOSED temporarily due to heavy flooding, rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions

Stay informed about road status and weather conditions

Effective immediately, all entrances to Yellowstone National Park are temporarily CLOSED due to substantial flooding, rockslides and mudslides on roadways from recent unprecedented amounts of rainfall and flooding.

Effective immediately, no inbound visitor traffic will be allowed into the park until conditions stabilize and the park can assess damage to roads and bridges and other facilities. This includes visitors with lodging and camping reservations.

Closed entrances include: North Northeast West South East

The power is out in multiple locations in the park.

Visitors planning on coming to Yellowstone in the upcoming weeks should pay close attention to the status of road conditions.

Many park roads may remain closed for an extended period of time.

Preliminary assessments show multiple sections of roads throughout the park have been either washed out or covered in mud or rocks, and multiple bridges may be affected.

Multiple roads in the southern portion of the park are also on the verge of being flooded, further restricting access.

With additional rainfall forecasted, the park does not want large numbers of day-use visitors stranded in the park.

Strains on wastewater and water treatment facilities could become a factor and the park is taking precautions to ensure facilities are not failing.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and state of Montana and Wyoming will work with the gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide support to residents.

Rainfall is expected to continue for the next several days. Flood levels measured on the Yellowstone River are beyond record levels.

Chapter 2

**-** ***Every inhale strips the lungs. Every wisp of wind shutters the nerves. It strips us down to our bones.*** 

&amp;#x200B;



The iridescent remains of the southern lights mixed with the twilight of polar winter, coloring the barren landscape and its twisting hills of wind-swept snow in a fading azure. The wind itself spoke in harsh tones and the drifts answered its calls by whipping themselves into small devils – obscuring visibility beyond a few meters before they spun themselves out of existence, revealing the fading aurora once again.

The reindeer looked up, lazily, and then around. At the edge of the herd, digging its head into the snow to find alien grasses, one of the creatures peered up against a feeling of unease. It was enough that the high winds made it difficult to hear, but in combination with the persistent darkness of the Antarctic winter and the large size of the herd, it would be easy for a potential predator to pick her off undetected.

Technically an invasive species themselves, reindeer had been the golden child of the Australian colonization efforts into what used to be the edge of the Ross ice shelf in the early twenty-first century – the primary motivating factor being that they were among some of the only large ungulates naturally suited for the frigid temperatures of the southernmost continent. The catalyst for their eventual takeover, as it had turned out, were the genetically modified grasses that the herd was now trotting over, kicking at the packed snow with their hooves to get at. CRIPSR-clipped grasses with the capability of withstanding ongoing sub-freezing temperature, roots long enough to reach solid ground through several meter-thick blankets of snow and ice were only the basic survival requirement of the flora – being nutritious and psychotropic enough to keep the reindeer fat and happy was what made them its most sought-after snack.

The young calf was completely unaware of all this, of course. It didn’t understand that it was among the only sources of organic meat left in the southern hemisphere, or that its species had become naturally docile as a result of having almost no natural predators within a few thousand kilometers – if any apex creatures, save humans, remained at all. It was still unaware of the turmoil that had emigrated its ancestors from Mongolian steppe and across oceans to find a new home – for as far as it was aware, this *was* its home.

It certainly wasn’t aware of the hyper-sonic slug that was powering its way out of the coils of a sniper rail on a hill half a kilometer away. 

It was, however, lucky enough to be dipping its head back down to search for some frozen vegetation when the slug reached its destination, piercing cleanly through its left antler and sending the undulate tumbling into the drift, neighing as it fell.

Far along the horizon, its predator hissed out a held-in breath and blinked into the scope.

“*Cunt.*”

June tracked the reindeer’s movements through her scope as it hobbled back to the main group, more confused than hurt. Even from this distance she could faintly hear its whining call, meaning that the herders would likely be coming around soon. Once they took notice, they would point their sleds away from the herd and begin their hunt, even if they didn’t know where exactly she happened to be camped. 

It was a danger she’d gambled on – to make a clean kill and collect her prize between the herder’s rounds, or to fumble the shot and risk discovery. She always had the option of going after the wild herds, which would give her the opportunity to take more than a missed shot before being made, but their location was never quite easy to puzzle out. The managed herds, on the other hand, used salvaged comms to manage themselves – and when old technology announced itself, it wasn’t exactly a top-tier job to crack it.

*Still*, she told herself, *the shot hit where I was aiming – it just so happened that the target was no longer there when the bullet arrived.* It was good to see that despite the wind and snow, her uncanny precision was as reliable as always. 

Her luck, however, was not.

Santiago never quite approved of her ritual pastime of stealing from the local herding group. She herself had always blamed the synthetic meat for making her do it – it hardly ever formed itself into proper fibers and so didn’t have the same texture – or provide the same stomach-filling satisfaction – as the real thing.

They had been sitting on the hill long enough for the snow to form a thin blanket along their flanks. June, laying prone underneath a white nano-fiber weave poncho – one that provided such conveniences as camouflage, protection, and warmth – gave a muted kick to ensure her companion was awake, though only as a gesture – Atlas, by design, didn’t sleep.

The spherical machine responded by spinning itself along a vertical axis, letting the accumulated snow slide down the six triangular carapace plates that composed the upper half of its protective shell. Along what would have been its equator, a single bulbous ocular unit blinked a neon-orange halo to indicate *yes, I am indeed still here.* A matching tri-pair of legs protruded from its bottom hemisphere, kicking at the piling snow, sending it sloshing onto the rifle’s scope.

It proceeded to tumble and repeatedly roll onto the adjacent pile of snow, quite content with its aim.

“I get that you want to get back,” June said through gritted teeth, “but trust me, you would understand the need for patience if you’d also been drinking nothing but synth and carb shakes for the past month.”

If Atlas heeded her words, it didn’t respond in any meaningful way. She took a moment to watch the pill bug-like machine roll to a stop before wiping the scope clean and peering through it once more. No easy prey could be seen, only a set of torch lights waving in the distance, pointing themselves towards the ground, then squarely in her direction. 

*Of course they heard the stupid deer*. 

Resigning herself with a sigh, she folded up her rifle, magnetically coupling it to a brace along the outside of her thigh. Gathering the rest of her belongings, she turned around and slid down the back of the hill. The poncho wrapped itself around her like a pale shroud, and a pair of goggles completed the alien-like look. Atlas followed, leaving a small valley to trace its rolling path down the hill.

When she stood, a vacuous chasm made itself known by pangs in her stomach, and her legs protested – half unfeeling cold and half aching muscle. The rations she got from the Port Jackson authorities were calculated specifically on a person-by-person basis, and rarely did they surpass the basic metabolic needs that they predetermined for her gender, height, and weight. June exacerbated the issue by attempting to maintain even a baseline level of fitness. The routine demanded more calories, yes, but she saw it as a necessary expenditure.

In the civilizational echo that was the city of Port Jackson, resources were about as limited as they could get – protein farms strained to put together a usable food supply from what little algae they could pilfer from the Southern Ocean, and anything organic, including vegetables, leafy greens, and especially meat, were delicacies. If it couldn’t be grown in a vat, it had to be bought – not rationed.

The rations, or lack thereof, had the dual effect of making people both desperate enough to steal from one another, and too weak to put up a fight against those hungrier than themselves. Santiago preferred to use the sheep-or-wolves analogy, whereas June didn’t care to give it a name as long as she was part of the winning coalition. Being able to defend herself, to call upon her muscles to sprint, if need be, was a basic, necessary requirement, and the extra calories needed to do so were in short supply. Acquiring them often required her to ger clever, whether that meant falsifying digital records to get double rations, or venturing into the outer drifts in search of her own food.

“It looks like we might have to settle for penguin this time, my little pillbug,” she said, motioning for the machine to blaze a trail in the snow ahead of her. Atlas had a set of supercapacitors storing days’ worth of energy inside – her legs featured no such convenience. As long as Port Jackson kept its massive reactors working, she’d gladly spend electrical energy over the caloric kind any day. It would be paid off later, stolen from an unguarded outlet – an empty stomach, on the other hand, was a constant gnawing problem with little in the way of reprieve.

They started in the last known direction of the nearest waddle – though June would prefer to call it a swarm, given the scale – several hours due north. June felt the lactic acid being to build in her numbing legs and contemplated how navigating the terrain, a relatively simple task only decades ago, had gradually gotten more and more difficult as the years went on. Global positioning system weren’t designed with Antarctic service as a top priority, and as a result, Atlas’s onboard navigation systems had to make do with hours or sometimes days-old telemetry data until a sufficient number of satellites passed overheard. 

Geostationary orbits, by their nature, did not support the southernmost continent, opting instead to track the equatorial regions. Constellations only briefly passed by overhead. Weather tracking satellites had been set up at some point, but suffered from the same timing issues, meaning that storms often brewed, struck, and dispersed before any satellite could fly by to warn its victims. In pre-crisis times, these issues, both in the southern and northernmost corners of the globe, might have been solved through the use of helium weather balloons which floated to the edge of space to retrieve precious atmospheric data before bursting, releasing the tiny molecules outwards to join the solar wind on its way beyond the blue planet.

*How nice it must be, to pick up and simply float away from scarcity.*

No balloons flew overhead that polar winter, nor had they for many. Helium, like everything else, was difficult to obtain and harder still to keep. The reactors needed them, as did the hospitals, so off went any reserves. The kids would have to make do with holographic mimicry for their birthdays.

The drifts shifted and changed, mud and rockslides carved up the terrain to make it unrecognizable from what it had been only weeks ago, and the gradual loosening of the Antarctic mantle – now devoid of kilometer-thick ice sheets and rebounding as a result – made earthquakes, sinkholes, and eruptions of methane pockets a real possibility.

Problems only begat more problems. Port Jackson had been built from the ground up to be sustainable, to endure what had brought pre-crisis cities to their knees – the rigidity that had toppled the skyscrapers and luxury condominium towers as they dared try to separate themselves from the planet that gave birth to them. No – Port Jackson was, in a word, flexible. Pre-fab structures that could be molded, stacked, and moved uphill as the seas rose. All-terrain transit systems that could trudge through both the winter ice and the summer mud pools. It had succeeded in lasting a few more decades than the rest of humanity, but how it would fare in the future was a fundamental gamble. The number of refugees, colloquially calling themselves citizens despite no charter to grant them such privileges, had long ago outnumbered the original Aussie population of water workers and relocationists. The resources needed to support them hadn’t quite been able to keep up.

*Hence, there’s a penguin somewhere out there with my name on it.* 

She had been walking in almost a sleep-like state, following Atlas’s trail through the snow that now rose like a valley up to her hips, made passable only by the machine’s weight pressing it down a few feet ahead, when it halted without warning, causing June to trip over it and dive head-first into the snowbank.

“Jesus, you could at least give me a warning next time you do that,” June said, reaching into her hood to remove chunks of snow that were already, unpleasantly, in her collar and halfway down her back. Atlas didn’t seem to mind June’s complaints – it had rotated onto its side, three triangular plates now open in a concave shape, tracking a silent white dot as it travelled imperceptibly across the sky.

June sat down next to it and took off her goggles, trying but failing to make out the distant target. “Anything useful streaming down?”

*Directions? A cooking feed to keep my stomach from gnawing itself, maybe?*

Atlas whined – *Busy now, some space please.* It was still going through the data packets. Before long, it bleeped in tones of surprise, follows by a slow hum of slight worry. June understood without needing to see the maps. The evidence was all around them. Getting to her feet, she scanned what little horizon remained. 

The storm would only get worse.

Still, Atlas projected a map of the surrounding regions and the last known location of the waddles it had grabbed from the passing satellite. Between June and her target stood what used to be a monolithic glacier – the remnants of which now paled in comparison. The resulting crevasses from the geriatric ice sheet posed a real danger to her, as well as a major obstacle for Atlas, who wouldn’t be able to roll across the scarred surface of the old giant. She could order the machine to crawl using its plates, but it would be far less efficient, eating up time they simply didn’t have.

June scanned the map, weighing the danger against the potential gains. Extending her hand, she dragged a finger in a winding motion across the virtual terrain. The projection lit up along her makeshift trail, painting the falling snow in a bright crimson glow.

“This might be the least risky route – for me and for you”, June said, scanning the path in front of her. “In about two kilometers due north-west I’m going to need you to stop rolling and get those claws out.”

Atlas followed her direction as the crevasses around them began to build, making the edge of the glacier apparent. They began as distant gaps where the falling light of the aurora was eaten by the darkness underneath, but soon became so numerous as to become the standard. As they hiked, June’s foot loosened a pile of snow and sent it tumbling over the edge of a dark scar which opened up less than a meter away on her right. A close call – and a lucky one. June gave the word and Atlas switched from a form of movement mimicking continuous-tracks to something more akin to that of a spider. The cobalt plates that made up Atlas’ carapace pierced into the icy expanse, making sure it could hang on or even make a quick lunge to safety if the next gap in the ice happened to open up directly beneath them.

June extended an ice-axe she’d stored on the outside of her pack, using it for support as they maneuvered around the cracks. Occasionally, she tested the snows with it, prodding and stabbing at the little hills and valleys along the impromptu trail. Atlas lit the way in front of her, occasionally providing momentary glimpses into the crags that seemed to materialize around them. Their edges protruded as if from nowhere, diving into blueish-blackness that held no fathomable end. She didn’t doubt that they had swallowed and crushed their fair share of unwelcome or unlucky travelers throughout their long, shifting lives.

Overhead, the storm began to rage. Uneven gusts threatened to lift June off her feet, forcing her into an almost-crouch. As the pair continued, the distance between them seemed to grow with each passing minute. The snow, now blowing sideways in a fury, made the visibility almost non-existent. Atlas began to pulse a neon-orange light in an attempt to pierce the storm.

June followed the path of the light as best she could. The length of time since she’d last eaten, atop the exhaustion of traversing the drifts in white-out conditions was overwhelming. In all, they made the journey magnitudes more punishing than she’d judged it for at the start. 

After her arrival in Port Jackson, she had always tried to see adversity as something to be pursued and overcome – nobody ever achieved growth or greatness by being comfortable, after all. It was a dual-edged predisposition, one that built her confidence and pushed her to survival in awful situations but resulted in many near-misses as well as some potential (and many actual) injuries.

She was determined to trek her way through the storm, to beat back its windy lashes and prove herself greater, as she continued to follow the orange-illuminated haze in front of her. Pulsing brightly, then dipping into darkness over and over.

As it rose from darkness, she failed to see the crevasse that Atlas angled left to avoid, only recognizing it when she tried to put her foot down – the snow on the edge giving way slightly, then all at once. Her stomach turned into a pit as the tumbling snow gave a glimpse of the endless darkness now rising up to engulf her. She managed only a single muted scream as the angled edge of the crevasse met her chest, her right hand now fiercely gripping the handle of the ice axe, scrapping it against the ice in an attempt to stop the fall.

Overhead, the orange glow blinked once again, then faded. Against her struggles, the darkness swallowed June in her entirety.

The storm continued to whip around Atlas, unrelenting. Quickly switching from the pulsating neon-orange light to a blinding blue-white beam, it maneuvered its way back to the spot where June had disappeared. The chasm was only about a meter and a half across, but stretched downwards like a winding snake before banking out of sight – a sharp wound on the skin of the monolithic ice field.

Atlas took a topographic reading of the structure and deduced that with enough piercing force, it might be able to hold itself horizontal across the gap – depending almost entirely on the brittleness of the ice. A blind call, with June’s life hanging in the balance – if not already decided.

The vertices of its carapace plates were sharp – talon-like – impregnated with cobalt and up to the task, but hadn’t been properly maintained for years. Ice climbing was not one of the machine’s common past-times, and certainly not an activity enjoyed by those who sought a long and healthy life – a group which June considered herself a valued member of.

Atlas backed up, allowing itself enough space to build momentum, then lunged forth, losing contact with the frozen ground. It fell a short distance into emptiness before extending and locking its servo motors in place, straining the connections, and piercing the adjacent walls with a deafening *crack*.

The cobalt tips held – for now. The machine was wedged across the width of the crevasse with all twelve of its claws holding its body against the icy walls using only friction and compressive force. Atlas continued to apply pressure against the outer wall as it slowly dialed down the force on half of its plates to take a single, measured step further into the blue void.

It inched its way down the nightmarish chimney, fully aware that even a single slip, just one miscalculation, would send it tumbling into the darkness where it would become wedged and left to rust until the glacier melted – however many more decades it might take.

Then, it spotted a shape about thirty meters down hanging limp in the chasm. It shone its beacon down the chasm and let off a cheerful *woot* as a pair of distressed hazel eyes, very much still clinging to life.

June’s right hand was fiercely gripping the ice axe, which was itself entombed at the base of two long scratch marks along the turquoise walls. Atlas ran a quick calculation of her fall and was astonished at the fact that she had managed not only to maneuver the axe into its current position while falling backwards into darkness, but that she had had the strength to grip it without it simply rending her hand and wrist apart. The feat itself was miraculous, owing to impressive dexterity, dumb luck, or a combination of the two.

“Atlas!” her voice echoed, shrill and strained. “Are you able to get down here? I’d try to climb up onto the axe but I’m not getting a tremendous sense of stability from the damn thing.”

Atlas scanned the surface of the ice again. Whatever maneuver they were going to have to pull off to return to the surface depended entirely on its ability to hold a fully grown person as well as a hundred and thirty kilo chunk of steel perpendicular against a wall of ice using nothing but friction and luck.

In response, it simply stared blankly at June. Their odds, admittedly, were not stupendous.

After a moment’s hesitation, it continued downwards, the deep blue hue of the ice now prevailing over the blackness that lay below them both. Step by step, the wall closed in on Atlas until only about the space of a closed fist remained on either side of it to maneuver. Climbing back up was going to be tricky even without factoring in that two of its legs would be busy holding on to June.

Upon reaching her, Atlas maneuvered itself, rotating ninety degrees to allow a pair of legs to drop down. June, now struggling to maintain a grip on the axe with her right hand, slowly inched her free hand upwards until she could wrap her fingers around the edges of the carapace. Bracing herself against the ice as best as she could, she shifted her weight off of the axe and onto the machine.

The sound of whining motors echoed up and down the structure as its joints strained against the added weight – but Atlas continued to hold position. June completed her maneuver – her weight was now fully supported by the machine hanging over her head.

Atlas lifted and replaced its legs one at a time, forcefully piercing the ice above and inching them both upwards.

June looked up, managing to catch a glimpse of what Atlas’s downward climb had done to the walls. Reflected off of the light, she could see slivers and cracks emanating deeply from the spots where the machine’s plates had pierced into the turquoise walls.

As Atlas’ leg pushed against the wall above, thick slab of ice broke off between the two of them, separated itself from the glacier, and tumbled downwards. June felt her stomach drop as one of the machine’s legs failed to grip the ice, sending them both sliding down. A sharp screeching noise ripped through her as metal scraped the ice like nails on a chalkboard, sending ice chips flying all around.

In an attempt to regain control, Atlas smacked one of the legs holding June straight into the wall without warning. The sudden movement left her reeling as she pulled on the only remaining leg. She yelped and kicked her feet out, trying to find anything that would support her weight along the walls, coming upon nothing except more uncaring ice.

Finally, her toes found the ice axe, still pinned between the walls. She tried to put weight on it, even a little, to let Atlas regain control and felt chunks the wall fall just centimeters from her face as the ice around Atlas delaminated and dropped into the darkness. She stepped fully on the axe, praying for it to hold.

What little luck remained gave way alongside it.

June’s body lurched downwards, hanging dearly onto Atlas. The machine kicked its feet harder into the crumbling sheets of ice as the sounds of clattering and crashing emanated from below. For a brief moment, they held. June and Atlas were left motionless. She looked up at the machine, which matched her gaze. It could see both the terror in her eyes and the abyss that awaited them below.

One final crack erupted around them, and the walls rushed upwards. The machine’s light module cracked and shattered against the side of the chasm, leaving them both blind as they plunged into the waiting dark.",redditserials,[Beneath a Midnight Earth] - Chapter 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/v1ximj/beneath_a_midnight_earth_chapter_2/,1654048877.0,rockslides,"[Beneath a Midnight Earth]
Beneath a Midnight Earth - [Cover Art] [Prologue] [Previous Chapter]

On the edges of the Antarctic city of Port Jackson, the remnants of Earth's southern cultures struggle for survival following a merciless climate crisis. Among them are June, a cunning specialist bent on securing her safety, Santiago, an upstart politician determined to help others, and Leo, who, along with his brother Gael, seek to take humanity's future into their own hands.

Tensions rise as fringe groups attempt to destabilize the uneasy peace, and when long-buried secrets begin to thaw amid the melting ice, they must work to hold the remnants of society together - or risk smothering out its last spark.

It didn’t understand that it was among the only sources of organic meat left in the southern hemisphere, or that its species had become naturally docile as a result of having almost no natural predators within a few thousand kilometers – if any apex creatures, save humans, remained at all. It was still unaware of the turmoil that had emigrated its ancestors from Mongolian steppe and across oceans to find a new home – for as far as it was aware, this was its home.

It certainly wasn’t aware of the hyper-sonic slug that was powering its way out of the coils of a sniper rail on a hill half a kilometer away.

It was, however, lucky enough to be dipping its head back down to search for some frozen vegetation when the slug reached its destination, piercing cleanly through its left antler and sending the undulate tumbling into the drift, neighing as it fell.

Far along the horizon, its predator hissed out a held-in breath and blinked into the scope.

“Cunt.”

June tracked the reindeer’s movements through her scope as it hobbled back to the main group, more confused than hurt. Even from this distance she could faintly hear its whining call, meaning that the herders would likely be coming around soon. Once they took notice, they would point their sleds away from the herd and begin their hunt, even if they didn’t know where exactly she happened to be camped.

It was a danger she’d gambled on – to make a clean kill and collect her prize between the herder’s rounds, or to fumble the shot and risk discovery. She always had the option of going after the wild herds, which would give her the opportunity to take more than a missed shot before being made, but their location was never quite easy to puzzle out. The managed herds, on the other hand, used salvaged comms to manage themselves – and when old technology announced itself, it wasn’t exactly a top-tier job to crack it.

Still, she told herself, the shot hit where I was aiming – it just so happened that the target was no longer there when the bullet arrived. It was good to see that despite the wind and snow, her uncanny precision was as reliable as always.

Her luck, however, was not.

Santiago never quite approved of her ritual pastime of stealing from the local herding group. She herself had always blamed the synthetic meat for making her do it – it hardly ever formed itself into proper fibers and so didn’t have the same texture – or provide the same stomach-filling satisfaction – as the real thing.

They had been sitting on the hill long enough for the snow to form a thin blanket along their flanks. June, laying prone underneath a white nano-fiber weave poncho – one that provided such conveniences as camouflage, protection, and warmth – gave a muted kick to ensure her companion was awake, though only as a gesture – Atlas, by design, didn’t sleep.

The spherical machine responded by spinning itself along a vertical axis, letting the accumulated snow slide down the six triangular carapace plates that composed the upper half of its protective shell. Along what would have been its equator, a single bulbous ocular unit blinked a neon-orange halo to indicate yes, I am indeed still here. A matching tri-pair of legs protruded from its bottom hemisphere, kicking at the piling snow, sending it sloshing onto the rifle’s scope.

It proceeded to tumble and repeatedly roll onto the adjacent pile of snow, quite content with its aim.

“I get that you want to get back,” June said through gritted teeth, “but trust me, you would understand the need for patience if you’d also been drinking nothing but synth and carb shakes for the past month.”

If Atlas heeded her words, it didn’t respond in any meaningful way. She took a moment to watch the pill bug-like machine roll to a stop before wiping the scope clean and peering through it once more. No easy prey could be seen, only a set of torch lights waving in the distance, pointing themselves towards the ground, then squarely in her direction.

Of course they heard the stupid deer.

Resigning herself with a sigh, she folded up her rifle, magnetically coupling it to a brace along the outside of her thigh. Gathering the rest of her belongings, she turned around and slid down the back of the hill. The poncho wrapped itself around her like a pale shroud, and a pair of goggles completed the alien-like look. Atlas followed, leaving a small valley to trace its rolling path down the hill.

When she stood, a vacuous chasm made itself known by pangs in her stomach, and her legs protested – half unfeeling cold and half aching muscle. The rations she got from the Port Jackson authorities were calculated specifically on a person-by-person basis, and rarely did they surpass the basic metabolic needs that they predetermined for her gender, height, and weight. June exacerbated the issue by attempting to maintain even a baseline level of fitness. The routine demanded more calories, yes, but she saw it as a necessary expenditure.

In the civilizational echo that was the city of Port Jackson, resources were about as limited as they could get – protein farms strained to put together a usable food supply from what little algae they could pilfer from the Southern Ocean, and anything organic, including vegetables, leafy greens, and especially meat, were delicacies. If it couldn’t be grown in a vat, it had to be bought – not rationed.

The rations, or lack thereof, had the dual effect of making people both desperate enough to steal from one another, and too weak to put up a fight against those hungrier than themselves. Santiago preferred to use the sheep-or-wolves analogy, whereas June didn’t care to give it a name as long as she was part of the winning coalition. Being able to defend herself, to call upon her muscles to sprint, if need be, was a basic, necessary requirement, and the extra calories needed to do so were in short supply. Acquiring them often required her to ger clever, whether that meant falsifying digital records to get double rations, or venturing into the outer drifts in search of her own food.

“It looks like we might have to settle for penguin this time, my little pillbug,” she said, motioning for the machine to blaze a trail in the snow ahead of her. Atlas had a set of supercapacitors storing days’ worth of energy inside – her legs featured no such convenience. As long as Port Jackson kept its massive reactors working, she’d gladly spend electrical energy over the caloric kind any day. It would be paid off later, stolen from an unguarded outlet – an empty stomach, on the other hand, was a constant gnawing problem with little in the way of reprieve.

They started in the last known direction of the nearest waddle – though June would prefer to call it a swarm, given the scale – several hours due north. June felt the lactic acid being to build in her numbing legs and contemplated how navigating the terrain, a relatively simple task only decades ago, had gradually gotten more and more difficult as the years went on. Global positioning system weren’t designed with Antarctic service as a top priority, and as a result, Atlas’s onboard navigation systems had to make do with hours or sometimes days-old telemetry data until a sufficient number of satellites passed overheard.

Geostationary orbits, by their nature, did not support the southernmost continent, opting instead to track the equatorial regions. Constellations only briefly passed by overhead. Weather tracking satellites had been set up at some point, but suffered from the same timing issues, meaning that storms often brewed, struck, and dispersed before any satellite could fly by to warn its victims. In pre-crisis times, these issues, both in the southern and northernmost corners of the globe, might have been solved through the use of helium weather balloons which floated to the edge of space to retrieve precious atmospheric data before bursting, releasing the tiny molecules outwards to join the solar wind on its way beyond the blue planet.

How nice it must be, to pick up and simply float away from scarcity.

No balloons flew overhead that polar winter, nor had they for many. Helium, like everything else, was difficult to obtain and harder still to keep. The reactors needed them, as did the hospitals, so off went any reserves. The kids would have to make do with holographic mimicry for their birthdays.

The drifts shifted and changed, mud and rockslides carved up the terrain to make it unrecognizable from what it had been only weeks ago, and the gradual loosening of the Antarctic mantle – now devoid of kilometer-thick ice sheets and rebounding as a result – made earthquakes, sinkholes, and eruptions of methane pockets a real possibility.

Problems only begat more problems. Port Jackson had been built from the ground up to be sustainable, to endure what had brought pre-crisis cities to their knees – the rigidity that had toppled the skyscrapers and luxury condominium towers as they dared try to separate themselves from the planet that gave birth to them. No – Port Jackson was, in a word, flexible. Pre-fab structures that could be molded, stacked, and moved uphill as the seas rose. All-terrain transit systems that could trudge through both the winter ice and the summer mud pools. It had succeeded in lasting a few more decades than the rest of humanity, but how it would fare in the future was a fundamental gamble. The number of refugees, colloquially calling themselves citizens despite no charter to grant them such privileges, had long ago outnumbered the original Aussie population of water workers and relocationists. The resources needed to support them hadn’t quite been able to keep up.

Hence, there’s a penguin somewhere out there with my name on it.

She had been walking in almost a sleep-like state, following Atlas’s trail through the snow that now rose like a valley up to her hips, made passable only by the machine’s weight pressing it down a few feet ahead, when it halted without warning, causing June to trip over it and dive head-first into the snowbank.

“Jesus, you could at least give me a warning next time you do that,” June said, reaching into her hood to remove chunks of snow that were already, unpleasantly, in her collar and halfway down her back. Atlas didn’t seem to mind June’s complaints – it had rotated onto its side, three triangular plates now open in a concave shape, tracking a silent white dot as it travelled imperceptibly across the sky.

June sat down next to it and took off her goggles, trying but failing to make out the distant target. “Anything useful streaming down?”

Directions? A cooking feed to keep my stomach from gnawing itself, maybe?

Atlas whined – Busy now, some space please. It was still going through the data packets. Before long, it bleeped in tones of surprise, follows by a slow hum of slight worry. June understood without needing to see the maps. The evidence was all around them. Getting to her feet, she scanned what little horizon remained.

The storm would only get worse.

Still, Atlas projected a map of the surrounding regions and the last known location of the waddles it had grabbed from the passing satellite. Between June and her target stood what used to be a monolithic glacier – the remnants of which now paled in comparison. The resulting crevasses from the geriatric ice sheet posed a real danger to her, as well as a major obstacle for Atlas, who wouldn’t be able to roll across the scarred surface of the old giant. She could order the machine to crawl using its plates, but it would be far less efficient, eating up time they simply didn’t have.

June scanned the map, weighing the danger against the potential gains. Extending her hand, she dragged a finger in a winding motion across the virtual terrain. The projection lit up along her makeshift trail, painting the falling snow in a bright crimson glow.

“This might be the least risky route – for me and for you”, June said, scanning the path in front of her. “In about two kilometers due north-west I’m going to need you to stop rolling and get those claws out.”

Atlas followed her direction as the crevasses around them began to build, making the edge of the glacier apparent. They began as distant gaps where the falling light of the aurora was eaten by the darkness underneath, but soon became so numerous as to become the standard. As they hiked, June’s foot loosened a pile of snow and sent it tumbling over the edge of a dark scar which opened up less than a meter away on her right. A close call – and a lucky one. June gave the word and Atlas switched from a form of movement mimicking continuous-tracks to something more akin to that of a spider. The cobalt plates that made up Atlas’ carapace pierced into the icy expanse, making sure it could hang on or even make a quick lunge to safety if the next gap in the ice happened to open up directly beneath them.

June extended an ice-axe she’d stored on the outside of her pack, using it for support as they maneuvered around the cracks. Occasionally, she tested the snows with it, prodding and stabbing at the little hills and valleys along the impromptu trail. Atlas lit the way in front of her, occasionally providing momentary glimpses into the crags that seemed to materialize around them. Their edges protruded as if from nowhere, diving into blueish-blackness that held no fathomable end. She didn’t doubt that they had swallowed and crushed their fair share of unwelcome or unlucky travelers throughout their long, shifting lives.

Overhead, the storm began to rage. Uneven gusts threatened to lift June off her feet, forcing her into an almost-crouch. As the pair continued, the distance between them seemed to grow with each passing minute. The snow, now blowing sideways in a fury, made the visibility almost non-existent. Atlas began to pulse a neon-orange light in an attempt to pierce the storm.

June followed the path of the light as best she could. The length of time since she’d last eaten, atop the exhaustion of traversing the drifts in white-out conditions was overwhelming. In all, they made the journey magnitudes more punishing than she’d judged it for at the start.

After her arrival in Port Jackson, she had always tried to see adversity as something to be pursued and overcome – nobody ever achieved growth or greatness by being comfortable, after all. It was a dual-edged predisposition, one that built her confidence and pushed her to survival in awful situations but resulted in many near-misses as well as some potential (and many actual) injuries.

She was determined to trek her way through the storm, to beat back its windy lashes and prove herself greater, as she continued to follow the orange-illuminated haze in front of her. Pulsing brightly, then dipping into darkness over and over.

As it rose from darkness, she failed to see the crevasse that Atlas angled left to avoid, only recognizing it when she tried to put her foot down – the snow on the edge giving way slightly, then all at once. Her stomach turned into a pit as the tumbling snow gave a glimpse of the endless darkness now rising up to engulf her. She managed only a single muted scream as the angled edge of the crevasse met her chest, her right hand now fiercely gripping the handle of the ice axe, scrapping it against the ice in an attempt to stop the fall.

Overhead, the orange glow blinked once again, then faded. Against her struggles, the darkness swallowed June in her entirety.

The storm continued to whip around Atlas, unrelenting. Quickly switching from the pulsating neon-orange light to a blinding blue-white beam, it maneuvered its way back to the spot where June had disappeared. The chasm was only about a meter and a half across, but stretched downwards like a winding snake before banking out of sight – a sharp wound on the skin of the monolithic ice field.

Atlas took a topographic reading of the structure and deduced that with enough piercing force, it might be able to hold itself horizontal across the gap – depending almost entirely on the brittleness of the ice. A blind call, with June’s life hanging in the balance – if not already decided.

The vertices of its carapace plates were sharp – talon-like – impregnated with cobalt and up to the task, but hadn’t been properly maintained for years. Ice climbing was not one of the machine’s common past-times, and certainly not an activity enjoyed by those who sought a long and healthy life – a group which June considered herself a valued member of.

Atlas backed up, allowing itself enough space to build momentum, then lunged forth, losing contact with the frozen ground. It fell a short distance into emptiness before extending and locking its servo motors in place, straining the connections, and piercing the adjacent walls with a deafening crack.

The cobalt tips held – for now. The machine was wedged across the width of the crevasse with all twelve of its claws holding its body against the icy walls using only friction and compressive force. Atlas continued to apply pressure against the outer wall as it slowly dialed down the force on half of its plates to take a single, measured step further into the blue void.

It inched its way down the nightmarish chimney, fully aware that even a single slip, just one miscalculation, would send it tumbling into the darkness where it would become wedged and left to rust until the glacier melted – however many more decades it might take.

Then, it spotted a shape about thirty meters down hanging limp in the chasm. It shone its beacon down the chasm and let off a cheerful woot as a pair of distressed hazel eyes, very much still clinging to life.

June’s right hand was fiercely gripping the ice axe, which was itself entombed at the base of two long scratch marks along the turquoise walls. Atlas ran a quick calculation of her fall and was astonished at the fact that she had managed not only to maneuver the axe into its current position while falling backwards into darkness, but that she had had the strength to grip it without it simply rending her hand and wrist apart. The feat itself was miraculous, owing to impressive dexterity, dumb luck, or a combination of the two.

“Atlas!” her voice echoed, shrill and strained. “Are you able to get down here? I’d try to climb up onto the axe but I’m not getting a tremendous sense of stability from the damn thing.”

Atlas scanned the surface of the ice again. Whatever maneuver they were going to have to pull off to return to the surface depended entirely on its ability to hold a fully grown person as well as a hundred and thirty kilo chunk of steel perpendicular against a wall of ice using nothing but friction and luck.

In response, it simply stared blankly at June. Their odds, admittedly, were not stupendous.

After a moment’s hesitation, it continued downwards, the deep blue hue of the ice now prevailing over the blackness that lay below them both. Step by step, the wall closed in on Atlas until only about the space of a closed fist remained on either side of it to maneuver. Climbing back up was going to be tricky even without factoring in that two of its legs would be busy holding on to June.

Upon reaching her, Atlas maneuvered itself, rotating ninety degrees to allow a pair of legs to drop down. June, now struggling to maintain a grip on the axe with her right hand, slowly inched her free hand upwards until she could wrap her fingers around the edges of the carapace. Bracing herself against the ice as best as she could, she shifted her weight off of the axe and onto the machine.

The sound of whining motors echoed up and down the structure as its joints strained against the added weight – but Atlas continued to hold position. June completed her maneuver – her weight was now fully supported by the machine hanging over her head.

Atlas lifted and replaced its legs one at a time, forcefully piercing the ice above and inching them both upwards.

June looked up, managing to catch a glimpse of what Atlas’s downward climb had done to the walls. Reflected off of the light, she could see slivers and cracks emanating deeply from the spots where the machine’s plates had pierced into the turquoise walls.

As Atlas’ leg pushed against the wall above, thick slab of ice broke off between the two of them, separated itself from the glacier, and tumbled downwards. June felt her stomach drop as one of the machine’s legs failed to grip the ice, sending them both sliding down. A sharp screeching noise ripped through her as metal scraped the ice like nails on a chalkboard, sending ice chips flying all around.

In an attempt to regain control, Atlas smacked one of the legs holding June straight into the wall without warning. The sudden movement left her reeling as she pulled on the only remaining leg. She yelped and kicked her feet out, trying to find anything that would support her weight along the walls, coming upon nothing except more uncaring ice.

Finally, her toes found the ice axe, still pinned between the walls. She tried to put weight on it, even a little, to let Atlas regain control and felt chunks the wall fall just centimeters from her face as the ice around Atlas delaminated and dropped into the darkness. She stepped fully on the axe, praying for it to hold.

What little luck remained gave way alongside it.

June’s body lurched downwards, hanging dearly onto Atlas. The machine kicked its feet harder into the crumbling sheets of ice as the sounds of clattering and crashing emanated from below. For a brief moment, they held. June and Atlas were left motionless. She looked up at the machine, which matched her gaze. It could see both the terror in her eyes and the abyss that awaited them below.

One final crack erupted around them, and the walls rushed upwards. The machine’s light module cracked and shattered against the side of the chasm, leaving them both blind as they plunged into the waiting dark.",[Beneath a Midnight Earth],[],None,,"Beneath a Midnight Earth - [Cover Art] [Prologue] [Previous Chapter]

On the edges of the Antarctic city of Port Jackson, the remnants of Earth's southern cultures struggle for survival following a merciless climate crisis. Among them are June, a cunning specialist bent on securing her safety, Santiago, an upstart politician determined to help others, and Leo, who, along with his brother Gael, seek to take humanity's future into their own hands.

Tensions rise as fringe groups attempt to destabilize the uneasy peace, and when long-buried secrets begin to thaw amid the melting ice, they must work to hold the remnants of society together - or risk smothering out its last spark.





Chapter 2

- Every inhale strips the lungs. Every wisp of wind shutters the nerves. It strips us down to our bones.





The iridescent remains of the southern lights mixed with the twilight of polar winter, coloring the barren landscape and its twisting hills of wind-swept snow in a fading azure. The wind itself spoke in harsh tones and the drifts answered its calls by whipping themselves into small devils – obscuring visibility beyond a few meters before they spun themselves out of existence, revealing the fading aurora once again.

The reindeer looked up, lazily, and then around. At the edge of the herd, digging its head into the snow to find alien grasses, one of the creatures peered up against a feeling of unease. It was enough that the high winds made it difficult to hear, but in combination with the persistent darkness of the Antarctic winter and the large size of the herd, it would be easy for a potential predator to pick her off undetected.

Technically an invasive species themselves, reindeer had been the golden child of the Australian colonization efforts into what used to be the edge of the Ross ice shelf in the early twenty-first century – the primary motivating factor being that they were among some of the only large ungulates naturally suited for the frigid temperatures of the southernmost continent. The catalyst for their eventual takeover, as it had turned out, were the genetically modified grasses that the herd was now trotting over, kicking at the packed snow with their hooves to get at. CRIPSR-clipped grasses with the capability of withstanding ongoing sub-freezing temperature, roots long enough to reach solid ground through several meter-thick blankets of snow and ice were only the basic survival requirement of the flora – being nutritious and psychotropic enough to keep the reindeer fat and happy was what made them its most sought-after snack.

June gave the word and Atlas switched from a form of movement mimicking continuous-tracks to something more akin to that of a spider. The cobalt plates that made up Atlas’ carapace pierced into the icy expanse, making sure it could hang on or even make a quick lunge to safety if the next gap in the ice happened to open up directly beneath them.

June extended an ice-axe she’d stored on the outside of her pack, using it for support as they maneuvered around the cracks. Occasionally, she tested the snows with it, prodding and stabbing at the little hills and valleys along the impromptu trail. Atlas lit the way in front of her, occasionally providing momentary glimpses into the crags that seemed to materialize around them. Their edges protruded as if from nowhere, diving into blueish-blackness that held no fathomable end. She didn’t doubt that they had swallowed and crushed their fair share of unwelcome or unlucky travelers throughout their long, shifting lives.

Overhead, the storm began to rage. Uneven gusts threatened to lift June off her feet, forcing her into an almost-crouch. As the pair continued, the distance between them seemed to grow with each passing minute. The snow, now blowing sideways in a fury, made the visibility almost non-existent. Atlas began to pulse a neon-orange light in an attempt to pierce the storm.

June followed the path of the light as best she could. The length of time since she’d last eaten, atop the exhaustion of traversing the drifts in white-out conditions was overwhelming. In all, they made the journey magnitudes more punishing than she’d judged it for at the start.

After her arrival in Port Jackson, she had always tried to see adversity as something to be pursued and overcome – nobody ever achieved growth or greatness by being comfortable, after all. It was a dual-edged predisposition, one that built her confidence and pushed her to survival in awful situations but resulted in many near-misses as well as some potential (and many actual) injuries.

She was determined to trek her way through the storm, to beat back its windy lashes and prove herself greater, as she continued to follow the orange-illuminated haze in front of her. Pulsing brightly, then dipping into darkness over and over.

As it rose from darkness, she failed to see the crevasse that Atlas angled left to avoid, only recognizing it when she tried to put her foot down – the snow on the edge giving way slightly, then all at once. Her stomach turned into a pit as the tumbling snow gave a glimpse of the endless darkness now rising up to engulf her. She managed only a single muted scream as the angled edge of the crevasse met her chest, her right hand now fiercely gripping the handle of the ice axe, scrapping it against the ice in an attempt to stop the fall.

Overhead, the orange glow blinked once again, then faded. Against her struggles, the darkness swallowed June in her entirety.

The storm continued to whip around Atlas, unrelenting. Quickly switching from the pulsating neon-orange light to a blinding blue-white beam, it maneuvered its way back to the spot where June had disappeared. The chasm was only about a meter and a half across, but stretched downwards like a winding snake before banking out of sight – a sharp wound on the skin of the monolithic ice field.

Atlas took a topographic reading of the structure and deduced that with enough piercing force, it might be able to hold itself horizontal across the gap – depending almost entirely on the brittleness of the ice. A blind call, with June’s life hanging in the balance – if not already decided.

The vertices of its carapace plates were sharp – talon-like – impregnated with cobalt and up to the task, but hadn’t been properly maintained for years. Ice climbing was not one of the machine’s common past-times, and certainly not an activity enjoyed by those who sought a long and healthy life – a group which June considered herself a valued member of.

Atlas backed up, allowing itself enough space to build momentum, then lunged forth, losing contact with the frozen ground. It fell a short distance into emptiness before extending and locking its servo motors in place, straining the connections, and piercing the adjacent walls with a deafening crack.

The cobalt tips held – for now. The machine was wedged across the width of the crevasse with all twelve of its claws holding its body against the icy walls using only friction and compressive force. Atlas continued to apply pressure against the outer wall as it slowly dialed down the force on half of its plates to take a single, measured step further into the blue void.

It inched its way down the nightmarish chimney, fully aware that even a single slip, just one miscalculation, would send it tumbling into the darkness where it would become wedged and left to rust until the glacier melted – however many more decades it might take.

Then, it spotted a shape about thirty meters down hanging limp in the chasm. It shone its beacon down the chasm and let off a cheerful woot as a pair of distressed hazel eyes, very much still clinging to life.

June’s right hand was fiercely gripping the ice axe, which was itself entombed at the base of two long scratch marks along the turquoise walls. Atlas ran a quick calculation of her fall and was astonished at the fact that she had managed not only to maneuver the axe into its current position while falling backwards into darkness, but that she had had the strength to grip it without it simply rending her hand and wrist apart. The feat itself was miraculous, owing to impressive dexterity, dumb luck, or a combination of the two.

“Atlas!” her voice echoed, shrill and strained. “Are you able to get down here? I’d try to climb up onto the axe but I’m not getting a tremendous sense of stability from the damn thing.”

Atlas scanned the surface of the ice again. Whatever maneuver they were going to have to pull off to return to the surface depended entirely on its ability to hold a fully grown person as well as a hundred and thirty kilo chunk of steel perpendicular against a wall of ice using nothing but friction and luck.

In response, it simply stared blankly at June. Their odds, admittedly, were not stupendous.

After a moment’s hesitation, it continued downwards, the deep blue hue of the ice now prevailing over the blackness that lay below them both. Step by step, the wall closed in on Atlas until only about the space of a closed fist remained on either side of it to maneuver. Climbing back up was going to be tricky even without factoring in that two of its legs would be busy holding on to June.

Upon reaching her, Atlas maneuvered itself, rotating ninety degrees to allow a pair of legs to drop down. June, now struggling to maintain a grip on the axe with her right hand, slowly inched her free hand upwards until she could wrap her fingers around the edges of the carapace. Bracing herself against the ice as best as she could, she shifted her weight off of the axe and onto the machine.

The sound of whining motors echoed up and down the structure as its joints strained against the added weight – but Atlas continued to hold position. June completed her maneuver – her weight was now fully supported by the machine hanging over her head.

Atlas lifted and replaced its legs one at a time, forcefully piercing the ice above and inching them both upwards.

June looked up, managing to catch a glimpse of what Atlas’s downward climb had done to the walls. Reflected off of the light, she could see slivers and cracks emanating deeply from the spots where the machine’s plates had pierced into the turquoise walls.

As Atlas’ leg pushed against the wall above, thick slab of ice broke off between the two of them, separated itself from the glacier, and tumbled downwards. June felt her stomach drop as one of the machine’s legs failed to grip the ice, sending them both sliding down. A sharp screeching noise ripped through her as metal scraped the ice like nails on a chalkboard, sending ice chips flying all around.

In an attempt to regain control, Atlas smacked one of the legs holding June straight into the wall without warning. The sudden movement left her reeling as she pulled on the only remaining leg. She yelped and kicked her feet out, trying to find anything that would support her weight along the walls, coming upon nothing except more uncaring ice.

Finally, her toes found the ice axe, still pinned between the walls. She tried to put weight on it, even a little, to let Atlas regain control and felt chunks the wall fall just centimeters from her face as the ice around Atlas delaminated and dropped into the darkness. She stepped fully on the axe, praying for it to hold.

What little luck remained gave way alongside it.

June’s body lurched downwards, hanging dearly onto Atlas. The machine kicked its feet harder into the crumbling sheets of ice as the sounds of clattering and crashing emanated from below. For a brief moment, they held. June and Atlas were left motionless. She looked up at the machine, which matched her gaze. It could see both the terror in her eyes and the abyss that awaited them below.

One final crack erupted around them, and the walls rushed upwards. The machine’s light module cracked and shattered against the side of the chasm, leaving them both blind as they plunged into the waiting dark.","beneath a midnight earth - [cover art] [prologue] [previous chapter]  on the edges of the antarctic city of port jackson, the remnants of earth's southern cultures struggle for survival following a merciless climate crisis. among them are june, a cunning specialist bent on securing her safety, santiago, an upstart politician determined to help others, and leo, who, along with his brother gael, seek to take humanity's future into their own hands.  tensions rise as fringe groups attempt to destabi",en,0.09700658704791654,Port Jackson|Antarctic|Earth,Port Jackson,38.894300000000044,-87.78984999999994,1.409,,,,,,

""Our first priority has been to evacuate the northern section of the park where we have multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues,"" superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement.

Visitors will be evacuated from the southern loop of the park starting later on Monday due to anticipated higher flood levels and concerns with water and wastewater systems, the statement said.

The northern loop is likely to be closed ""for a substantial amount of time,"" and the park's reopening will be determined after flood waters recede and damage is assessed.

Park staff is working with the county and state to provide support to residents of Gardiner, Montana, a town just north of the park that is currently isolated by the dangerous conditions, the statement said.

""With additional rainfall forecasted, the park does not want large numbers of day-use visitors stranded in the park,"" the park said on Facebook and its website.

According to National Park Service data from 2014 to 2018, more than 780,000 people typically visit the park in June.

""The river has never been this high before by my house,"" said Elizabeth Aluck, a resident of Gardiner, which serves as a gateway for visitors.

As of Monday afternoon, Aluck said she was unable to evacuate because roads and bridges in the area are washed out.

Travelers with plans to visit Yellowstone National Park in the coming weeks should monitor road conditions , the park advised.

'Things have gotten rougher'

A family staying at a short-term rental house in Gardiner near the park entrance is now unable to leave their rental cabin due to flooding in the area.

Indiana couple Melissa and Parker Manning told CNN they arrived at their rental on Saturday with their family, and expected to leave Monday morning.

""That's not happening any time soon,"" Parker Manning said. ""The water levels were high on Saturday but within the past 10-12 hours things have gotten rougher.""

The couple joined a call with emergency management officials Monday afternoon. Officials on the call suggested local businesses consider food rationing, just in case.

Manning said they did go to the grocery store, and everyone was being smart about what to stock up on and not panicking.

""Our way out of town would be north on 89, but those roads are currently all underwater,"" Manning said.

The couple has no idea when they will be able to leave the town, but Manning hopes it will be within the next 48 hours.

The host of their rental was very understandable of the situation, Manning added.

Avoid streams and creeks

Earlier Monday, the park said in a news release roads in the northern portion of the park would be temporarily closed for ""an extended period of time"" before posting the wider closure.

""Preliminary assessments show multiple sections of road in the park have been washed out between Gardiner and Cooke City, Montana, and multiple bridges may be affected,"" the release said, adding visitors in the northern portion are being evacuated.

The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the park on Monday and advised campers and hikers to avoid streams and creeks.

""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads,"" the NWS cautioned those in vehicles.

Mammoth, Osprey Falls, Indian Creek Campground and Lava Creek Campgrounds, all located in the park, are locations expected to experience floods, the weather service said.

All entrances to Yellowstone National Park were closed Monday and would be through at least Wednesday as heavy rain falling on melting snow caused significant flooding and road damage, park officials announced.

Calling it “extremely hazardous conditions,” authorities evacuated the northern portion of the park due to flooding, rockslides and mudslides caused by record rainfall.

Park officials announced on Monday afternoon that the park would be closed to visitors until at least Wednesday.

“Red Lodge, Montana, is a river right now and we have some flooding on the west of Cody,” Cody Beers, a Wyoming Department of Transportation spokesman, told Cowboy State Daily. “I’ve never heard of Yellowstone closing the entire park to inbound traffic, though.”

Footage from the storms showed roads collapsing into raging rivers and logs piled high on the shores.

The electricity was out in several areas of the park as of Monday morning.

All inbound traffic to the park was halted until conditions stabilized and park officials could assess damage to the roads, bridges and other facilities. The visitors turned away included those with lodging and camping reservations.

Many of the park roads could be closed for an extended period of time, according to park officials.

“It’s just been multiple days of rain up in this area, plus we had snow on Memorial Day weekend,” Beers said. “It’s a rare day when we have water levels that reached the bottom of our bridges.”

Cowboy State Daily meteorologist Don Day said flood advisories surround Yellowstone because of the “huge amount of snow” coupled with the significant rain.

“I don’t think anyone thought the runoff would be as big as this,” he said.

Beers said WYDOT will continue to monitor the weather events in the northwestern portion of the state and how they might affect roads.

He recommended anyone traveling toward Yellowstone wait a day or two for officials to figure out how long certain roads will be closed and whether the rainfall in the area will continue.

“Be careful out there, because Mother Nature’s fury is showing itself right now,” Beers said.

Yellowstone superintendent Cam Sholly said on Monday that staff’s first priority was to evacuate the northern section of the park, where there were multiple road and bridge failures, mudslides and other issues.

“The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and State of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,” Sholly said. “Due to predictions of higher flood levels in areas of the park’s southern loop, in addition to concerns with water and wastewater systems, we will begin to move visitors in the southern loop out of the park later today in coordination with our in-park business partners.”

Sholly said it was likely the northern loop of the park would be closed for a substantial amount of time.

“I appreciate the efforts of the Yellowstone team and partners to safely evacuate areas of the park and of our gateway community partners who are helping us through this major event,” he said. “We appreciate the support offered by the Department of Interior, National Park Service and the Montana and Wyoming governors.”

ST. GEORGE — A significant rock slide occurred in Zion National Park on Tuesday morning around 9 a.m. and covered part of a road.

Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, north of the Grotto, was blocked and shuttle buses could not pass the slide, said Jonathan Shafer, Zion National Park public affairs specialist.

Within 30 minutes, however, the Zion Canyon Scenic Scenic Drive north of the Grotto was reopened and remains open. The rocks have been cleared and buses are running again. Shafer cautioned that pedestrians should avoid the area today.

One of the larger rock slides in Zion National Park occurred in August 2019 bove the Weeping Rock shuttle stop in the main canyon. According to St. George News, the immense rockslide injured three people, and several others were temporarily stranded. A large slab of Navajo Sandstone detached from Cable Mountain almost 2,000 vertical feet above the Weeping Rock parking lot.

ST. GEORGE — A significant rock slide occurred in Zion National Park on Tuesday morning around 9 a.m. and covered part of a road.

Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, north of the Grotto, was blocked and shuttle buses could not pass the slide, said Jonathan Shafer, Zion National Park public affairs specialist.

Within 30 minutes, however, the Zion Canyon Scenic Scenic Drive north of the Grotto was reopened and remains open. The rocks have been cleared and buses are running again. Shafer cautioned that pedestrians should avoid the area today.

One of the larger rock slides in Zion National Park occurred in August 2019 bove the Weeping Rock shuttle stop in the main canyon. According to St. George News, the immense rockslide injured three people, and several others were temporarily stranded. A large slab of Navajo Sandstone detached from Cable Mountain almost 2,000 vertical feet above the Weeping Rock parking lot.

At the time, the 2019 rockslide closed some popular hiking trails, including Weeping Rock trail, Observation Point Trail and Hidden Canyon Trail. For the latest updates on the park visit the Zion National Park website.

Brockholes Brow will be closed over summer Pic: Google

The A59 at Brockholes Brow is due to be closed over the summer for vital work to stabilise an embankment.

A lane has been closed on the road since March 2021 when a small landslip occurred on a steep wooded embankment next to the road, resulting in part of the slope encroaching on to the road.

Read more: Emergency lane closure in place on A59 at Brockholes Brow following landslip

Monitoring over the past six months has found that the embankment is continuing to move at a rate of around 10cm a month, with intervention being urgently needed to stabilise it and restore the full width of the road and pavement.

Work is scheduled to begin on Monday 25 July to stop the embankment from moving and mitigate the risk of a bigger landslip occurring if left in its current state.

The closure will have a major impact on access to and from the east of Preston, as well as travel north or south via the M6 motorway.

Work is expected to take up to seven weeks, with the road needing to be fully closed in both directions for all vehicles and pedestrians for safety and to allow access for the heavy machinery needed.

The scheme has been scheduled during the school holidays when traffic levels are lower to minimise disruption as much as possible, and work will take place 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to minimise the duration of the closure.

Preston City Council owns the embankment where the landslip has occurred, and has engaged Lancashire County Council as the highways authority for the area to design a solution and carry out the work.

The project involves:

Installing large sheet metal piles as a retaining structure along a 40-metre length of the embankment

Building a 1.2m high retaining wall along the same length

Installing drainage to help protect the embankment from wet weather in the future

Removing excess material from the bottom of the slope to restore the full width of the road and pavement

Landscaping work and planting species native to the existing woodland

Removing the current lane closure and restoring the 40mph speed limit

While the road is closed the County Council is also planning a range of other routine highway maintenance in the vicinity to avoid the need for further lane closures in future and minimise the overall level of disruption.

Early consultation on the proposed closure has already taken place with emergency services and National Highways, who are responsible for the M6 motorway, and a notice has recently been posted on Lancashire County Council’s website.

Residents in the vicinity are due to receive a letter very shortly, and Preston City Council is currently in the process of visiting local businesses to inform them of the situation.

Adrian Phillips, Chief Executive at Preston City Council, said: “It’s vital that we carry out this work to safeguard the A59 by stabilising the embankment on Brockholes Brow, and unfortunately the only way to do this is to fully close the road due to the scale of the work which is needed.

“The embankment is still moving towards the road following the landslip which occurred in 2021 and, without this scheme to stabilise it and retain the banking, the situation would keep getting worse until there would be no option but to close the road for safety anyway.

“This will clearly be very disruptive, particularly for people who use this route regularly, local businesses, and those who live nearby, and we’re very sorry for the impact this will have on them, however we’ll be making all efforts to minimise this by working around the clock to get the road reopened as soon as we can.

“We are in the process of visiting local businesses, and residents in the immediate area should receive a letter in the next few days. While we can’t do anything about the need to close the road, we will do our best to answer any queries people may have and respond to any issues people may want to raise.”

Boaters on Lake Powell this past weekend caught on camera a massive rockslide as it collapsed into the water.

The footage shows the sandstone cliff starting to tilt toward the water below, before collapsing and sending a towering spray into the sky and large waves across the lake.

Joseph Cook, from the Arizona Geological Survey, told Arizona’s Family News that the collapse could have been caused in part by the lake’s recent extremely low water levels.

Mr Cook said that the rock cleaving could have been exacerbated by being saturated with water, and then drying out.

Lake Powell was formed when a dam was built on the Colorado River, filling in Glen Canyon along the border of Utah and Arizona. As a result areas of the canyon wall, naturally far above the riverbed, were surrounded by water.

However a two-decade “megadrought” has wreaked havoc across the American West and caused Lake Powell’s water level to drop precipitously, leaving the canyon much emptier than before.

In 1999, Lake Powell held about seven trillion gallons of water. Today, the lake holds about two trillion gallons — and the lake’s surface has dropped by around 160 feet.

The ongoing drought doesn’t just threaten recreational boaters, either. Lake Powell — and nearby Lake Mead, behind the Hoover Dam — are both important drinking water reservoirs for the US Southwest. Both lakes hit record lows this year.

Over 80 percent of the Colorado River basin is currently experiencing “severe drought” conditions, according to the US government’s drought monitor.

Recently, a report named the Colorado the most threatened river in the country, in large part due to drought.

The climate crisis is only expected to worsen droughts in the Southwest. A 2020 study found that the Colorado River’s flow could be reduced by around 9 per cent for every degree Celsius of warming.",Massive rockslide at drought-stricken Lake Powell caught on video,['Ethan Freedman'],None,,"Boaters on Lake Powell this past weekend caught on camera a massive rockslide as it collapsed into the water.

GARDINER, Mont. – Yellowstone National Park officials assessed widespread damage Tuesday as the park remained closed amid dangerous floods, mudslides and rockslides that have eroded roads, ripped apart bridges and forced evacuations this week.

The water started to slowly recede Tuesday and one key highway reopened, but the record-level floods left all five entrances to the park closed through at least Wednesday, officials said. And, officials said during an update on Tuesday, the water levels could still change at any time.

“The water is still raging,” said Park Superintendent Cam Sholly, who added that more wet weather was forecast this weekend, which could cause additional flooding.

The park, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, has seen multiple road and bridge failures, power outages and mudslides, causing the evacuations of more than 10,000 visitors from the park.

“I’ve never seen this, not in my lifetime,” said Austin King, a firefighter and EMT in Gardiner, a town just outside Yellowstone's busy northern entrance.

There were no reports of injuries or deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, but floodwaters swept away a number of homes, bridges and other structures. The northern part of the park suffered the worst damage.

The full scope of the damage was not known Tuesday, leaving it unclear when roads might reopen or when residents in neighboring communities might be able to return.

The northern loop of Yellowstone National Park was cleared of visitors and park officials were working to evacuate visitors in the southern area of the park Tuesday. Park staff were searching for five back-country groups to ensure they were safely evacuated.

Meanwhile, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster and said the Montana National Guard rescued 12 people stranded by high waters in Roscoe and Cooke City.

Highways reopen as floodwaters recede

The Yellowstone River reached highs of almost 14 feet on Monday, far higher than the record 11.5 feet set more than a century ago, according the the National Weather Service.

Although the water was still ""extremely"" high, a route out of Gardiner, a town of about 900 people, reopened Tuesday afternoon, according to county Commissioner Bill Berg and Sholly.

Visitors could drive out using U.S. Highway 89 and East River Road, but only residents and service vehicles were allowed to drive back inside. While some residents questioned if they could wait a few days before leaving town, Berg and Sholly were adamant: “Get out of Gardiner.”

""We are working with the county and state of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,"" Yellowstone officials said Monday.

A smaller highway into the previously isolated Cooke City also reopened to local traffic and emergency services Tuesday afternoon.

Yellowstone communities left stranded, without power

The flooding left some of Yellowstone's small gateway communities in southern Montana isolated and without power, leading to evacuations by boat and helicopter.

Floodwaters isolated areas including Silvergate, which is east of the park, and led to evacuations in Livingston. As Stillwater River in south-central Montana flooded, 68 people were stranded at a campground as crews rescued campers by raft.

Officials in Park County, which encompasses those cities, issued shelter-in-place orders Monday and warned flooding had made drinking water unsafe in many communities. Residents hauled bottled water home from stores and worried about a possible food shortage.

Many in Gardiner have used only bottled water to brush their teeth, wash dishes and prepare food due to a break in the area's main water service line. The community was under an advisory to boil water before consumption as of Tuesday afternoon.

The county said water and air rescues were underway amid evacuations Monday.

""Extensive flooding throughout Park County has washed out bridges, roads, and left communities and homes isolated,"" Park County said in a statement.

A 10-person bunker was among the buildings that slipped from the riverbank into the water. Only a portion of the building's foundation remained Tuesday.

Parker Manning, who was visiting from Terre Haute, Indiana, watched the flooding from a cabin in Gardiner. He said he saw trees and a mostly intact house floating in rushing waters.

In the south-central Montana town of Joliet, Kristan Apodaca cried as she watched floodwaters overtake her grandmother's log cabin and the park where her husband proposed.

""I am sixth-generation,"" she told the Billings Gazette. ""This is our home.""

King, the EMT in Gardiner, said the flooding was ""damaging for a lot of people.""

""Some have lost their houses; others can’t go to work,"" King said. ""People are worried about food shortages already.""

When will Yellowstone reopen?

Yellowstone officials have prohibited visitors from entering the park at any of its five entrances until at least Wednesday.

Sholly said the park could remain closed as long as a week, and northern entrances may not reopen at all this summer.

Cory Mottice, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Billings, Montana, said reduced rain and cooler temperatures, which could lead to decreased snowmelt, may lessen flooding.

Still, ""this is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,"" Mottice said.

Why is Yellowstone flooding?

Record rainfall combined with rapidly melting snowpack caused the deluge of flooding this week. Scientists pointed to climate change as the culprit behind more intense and frequent weather events.

The flooding happened as the summer tourist season was ramping up. June is one of the park's busiest months.

What state is Yellowstone National Park in?

The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park encompasses nearly 3,500 square miles on top of a volcanic hot spot. The park lies mostly in Wyoming but spreads into Montana and Idaho.

The park allows visitors ""to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River,"" according to the Yellowstone's website.

""The community of Gardiner is currently isolated, and we are working with the county and state of Montana to provide necessary support to residents, who are currently without water and power in some areas,"" Yellowstone officials said Monday.

Floodwaters also isolated Cooke City and led to evacuations in Livingston. As Stillwater River in south-central Montana flooded, 68 people were stranded at a campground as crews rescued campers by raft.

Officials in Park County, which encompasses these cities, issued shelter-in-place orders Monday, warning flooding had made drinking water unsafe in many communities. Residents hauled bottled water home from stores and worried about a potential food shortage. The county said water and air rescues were underway amid evacuations Monday.

""Extensive flooding throughout Park County has washed out bridges, roads, and left communities and homes isolated,"" Park County said in a statement.

When will Yellowstone reopen?

Yellowstone officials have prohibited visitors from entering the park at any of its five entrances until at least Wednesday.

Cory Mottice, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Billings, Montana, said reduced rain and cooler temperatures, which could lead to decreased snowmelt, may lessen flooding.

Still, ""this is flooding that we’ve just never seen in our lifetimes before,"" Mottice said.

Why is Yellowstone flooding?

Record rainfall combined with rapidly melting snowpack caused the deluge of flooding this week with scientists pointing to climate change as the culprit behind more intense and frequent weather events.

The floods came as the summer tourist season was ramping up in June, one of the park's busiest months.

What state is Yellowstone National Park in?

The world's first national park, Yellowstone National Park is a nearly 3,500-square-mile wilderness park on top of a volcanic hot spot. It's mostly in Wyoming but also spreads into Montana and Idaho.

The park allows visitors ""to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the world’s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River,"" according to the Yellowstone's website.

“I’ve never seen this, not in my lifetime,” said Austin King, a firefighter and EMT in Gardiner, a town just outside Yellowstone's busy northern entrance.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, but floodwaters swept away numerous homes, bridges and other structures with the northern part of the park suffering the worst damage.

Parker Manning, who is visiting from Terre Haute, Indiana, watched the flooding from a cabin in Gardiner. He said he saw trees and a mostly intact house floating in rushing floodwaters.

The Yellowstone River reached highs of almost 14 feet on Monday, far higher than the previous record of 11.5 feet set more than a century ago, according the the National Weather Service.

-----------

#INTRO

Although recent news reports mostly discuss about the single worst case earthquake scenario, there are actually several other scenarios that can also occur. After the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, Japan's Cabinet Office and the Headquarters for Earthquake Research selected several likely earthquake scenarios that can impact Tokyo. Each scenario was chosen based on its probability of happening soon or how destructive they could potentially be.

The goal of the report is to have a realistic simulation of human/city damage. This helps people efficiently make rules, plan emergency responses, and spend money without going overboard. For example, it wouldn't make sense to spend millions and waste time and manpower building a 12.5 meter high tsunami wall (the actual height of the new wall in Rikuzentakata, Iwate) around Tokyo if the simulations predict only a 2.6 meter tsunami (the current simulated prediction).

-------------------

#LIMITATIONS

Japan is experienced dealing with earthquakes. However, they note that our knowledge of the earthquake mechanisms is still limited. Not only that, there are only a limited number of past large earthquakes they can pull data from to help estimate future damage.

The simulation is also based on a number of assumptions, like damage to transportation (trains, cars, Shinkansen, etc.), lifelines (electricity, water, communications, etc.) and the exact location of where the earthquake will happen (different parts of Tokyo will have different ground motions or ground liquification). So the damage numbers do not represent all of the damage that could be expected. It's also possible that people will respond differently than in past disasters or how they responded to disaster questionnaires. 

But even so, the report aims to paint an overall ""picture"" of a disaster scenario based on Japan's history and the latest sciences and data available.

--------------

#SIMULATED CONDITIONS

Conditions were simulated to be:

* Winter season
* 6:00 PM
* 8 m/s wind speed

The time of day, season, and weather conditions change throughout the year. However, fire hazards are highest during the evening winter when people are home and fire appliances are being used. Some homes are old and are at risk of collapse. There are also many people around offices, downtown areas, and stations at risk of falling objects. Railways and roads are packed at rush hour and can make it difficult for emergency services to respond. Wind speeds were assumed to be normal at 4 m/s and strong at 8 m/s.

Using data from recent earthquakes that killed over 300 people in Japan, the simulated deaths and injuries are calculated by various factors such as:

* Time of day
* Population density
* Population indoors/outdoors
* Population age
* Traffic flow/density
* Building age
* Building retention rates
* Building type (wood vs non-wood)
* Falling down
* Falling indoor/outdoor objects
* Falling block walls
* Falling vending machines
* Steep slope failure 
* Land liquification
* People who have difficulty escaping on their own
* Fire damage (failure to escape, buried alive, or caught in fire while escaping)
* Tsunami (public's evacuation awareness, evacuation speeds by terrain, population by floor)

--------------

#FALLING VENDING MACHINES

The ""falling vending machines"" factor might seem strange, but there were over 4,045,800 vending machines reported in Japan in December 2020. This is an example of how they calculate one of the factors in the simulation.

In the simulation, vending machines are treated as concrete walls, but corrected for the average width of the machines. In 1978, an earthquake near Miyagi caused nearly 14,000 walls to collapse and fatally crushed 18 people. This earthquake led to a major revision of earthquake codes in Japan. But even with the revision, in 2018 an earthquake near Osaka caused concrete walls to kill 2 people, including a a 9-year old girl on her way to school. 

The high number of vending machines installed in the country are placed in locations with high foot traffic, and are at risk of falling over during earthquakes, especially if they're not properly fitted. 

Injury/death calculations were done by:

* Vending machine installation ratio by district
* Daytime/nighttime population
* Rate of installed vending machine fall prevention measures
* Vending machine fall rate from the 1995 Kobe Earthquake (this earthquake killed over 6,400 people, 90% due to being crushed or suffocated)
* Number of deaths/injuries from fallen stone walls due to the ground acceleration of the 1978 Miyagi Earthquake

With this, they calculate 205 people being fatally crushed by concrete walls, vending machines, etc. if there's a M7.3 earthquake in southern Tokyo (the worst case scenario), and 7,057 people being seriously injured.

#HOW TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE

Factors that help bring down building damage, death rates, and injury rates are:

* Increasing rate of earthquake-resistant buildings   

Currently 92% of Tokyo's residential buildings meet the 1981 building standards. They want to work towards 100% of 1981 standards, or start shifting towards the newer year 2000 building standards. 

If this goal is reached, the number of destroyed buildings and deaths can decrease by 60%.

* Increasing rate of people taking measures to make indoor furniture fall-proof   

Currently 57.3% of people have implemented ways to prevent furniture from falling. They want to work towards 75% or 100%, and make sure people implement them correctly. 23% of the furniture measures in the 1995 Kobe Earthquake were installed wrong and ineffective. 

If these goals are reached, the number of deaths and injuries can decrease by 40-80%.

* Increasing fire suppression measures  

Currently 8.3% have seismic breakers installed to prevent electrical fires, and 36.6% of fires suppressed when they start. They want 25-50% to have seismic breakers, and 60-90% of fires to be initially extinguished. 

If these goals are reached, the number of destroyed homes and deaths can decrease by 70-90%.

Since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Tokyo wards have been implementing projects to make urban areas more fire-proof, such as splitting the city into firebreak zones using roads, rivers, rails, parks, and fire-resistant buildings. This will further reduce damage by fires.

* Increasing awareness of tsunami evacuation

Currently 38.7% would evacuate immediately, 58.0% would evacuate after some errands, and 3.3% would not evacuate. It is assumed that evacuation would start about 10 minutes after the disaster occurs in the early morning. They want to raise immediate evacuation to 100%, and everything else to 0%. They also want to decrease the response time down to 5 minutes, and increase evacuation speed by x1.5.

If these goals are reached, the number of deaths can be reduced to 0.

* Increase and improve earthquake resistance and fire prevention to reduce economic damage

The earthquake will damage homes and lifelines as well as businesses and supply chains. They predict about ￥95.3 trillion (or about USD $744.8 billion) in indirect and direct damage nationwide.

If buildings' earthquake resistances and fire prevention measures are improved, economic damage can be reduced by ￥5.5-9.0 trillion (or USD $43.1-70.6 billion).

Japan is experienced dealing with earthquakes. However, they note that our knowledge of the earthquake mechanisms is still limited. Not only that, there are only a limited number of past large earthquakes they can pull data from to help estimate future damage.

The simulation is also based on a number of assumptions, like damage to transportation (trains, cars, etc.), lifelines (electricity, water, communications, etc.) and the exact location of where the earthquake will happen (different parts of Tokyo will have different ground motions or ground liquification). So the damage numbers do not represent all of the damage that could be expected. It's also possible that people will respond differently than in past disasters or how they responded to disaster questionnaires.

But even so, the report aims to paint an overall ""picture"" of a disaster scenario based on Japan's history and the latest sciences and data available.

SIMULATED CONDITIONS

Conditions were simulated to be:

Winter season

6:00 PM

8 m/s wind speed

The time of day, season, and weather conditions change throughout the year. However, fire hazards are highest during the evening winter when people are home and fire appliances are being used. Some homes are old and are at risk of collapse. There are also many people around offices, downtown areas, and stations at risk of falling objects. Railways and roads are packed at rush hour and can make it difficult for emergency services to respond. Wind speeds were assumed to be normal at 4 m/s and strong at 8 m/s.

Using data from recent earthquakes that killed over 300 people in Japan, the simulated deaths and injuries are calculated by various factors such as:

Time of day

Population density

Population indoors/outdoors

Population age

Traffic flow/density

Building age

Building retention rates

Building type (wood vs non-wood)

Falling down

Falling indoor/outdoor objects

Falling block walls

Falling vending machines

Steep slope failure

Land liquification

People who have difficulty escaping on their own

Fire damage (failure to escape, buried alive, or caught in fire while escaping)

Tsunami (public's evacuation awareness, evacuation speeds by terrain, population by floor)

FALLING VENDING MACHINES

The ""falling vending machines"" factor might seem strange, but there were over 4,045,800 vending machines reported in Japan in December 2020. This is an example of how they calculate one of the factors in the simulation.

In the simulation, vending machines are treated as concrete walls, but corrected for the average width of the machines. In 1978, an earthquake near Miyagi caused nearly 14,000 walls to collapse and fatally crushed 18 people. This earthquake led to a major revision of earthquake codes in Japan. But even with the revision, in 2018 an earthquake near Osaka caused concrete walls to kill 2 people, including a a 9-year old girl on her way to school.

The high number of vending machines installed in the country are placed in locations with high foot traffic, and are at risk of falling over during earthquakes, especially if they're not properly fitted.

Injury/death calculations were done by:

Vending machine installation ratio by district

Daytime/nighttime population

Rate of installed vending machine fall prevention measures

Vending machine fall rate from the 1995 Kobe Earthquake (this earthquake killed over 6,400 people, 90% due to being crushed or suffocated)

Number of deaths/injuries from fallen stone walls due to the ground acceleration of the 1978 Miyagi Earthquake

With this, they calculate 205 people being fatally crushed by concrete walls, vending machines, etc. if there's a M7.3 earthquake in southern Tokyo (the worst case scenario), and 7,057 people being seriously injured.

HOW TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE

Factors that help bring down building damage, death rates, and injury rates are:

Increasing rate of earthquake-resistant buildings

Currently 92% of Tokyo's residential buildings meet the 1981 building standards. They want to work towards 100% of 1981 standards, or start shifting towards the newer year 2000 building standards.

If this goal is reached, the number of destroyed buildings and deaths can decrease by 60%.

Increasing rate of people taking measures to make indoor furniture fall-proof

Currently 57.3% of people have implemented ways to prevent furniture from falling. They want to work towards 75% or 100%, and make sure people implement them correctly. 23% of the furniture measures in the 1995 Kobe Earthquake were installed wrong and ineffective.

If these goals are reached, the number of deaths and injuries can decrease by 40-80%.

Increasing fire suppression measures

Currently 8.3% have seismic breakers installed to prevent electrical fires, and 36.6% of fires suppressed when they start. They want 25-50% to have seismic breakers, and 60-90% of fires to be initially extinguished.

If these goals are reached, the number of destroyed homes and deaths can decrease by 70-90%.

Since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Tokyo wards have been implementing projects to make urban areas more fire-proof, such as splitting the city into firebreak zones using roads, rivers, rails, parks, and fire-resistant buildings. This will further reduce damage by fires.

Increasing awareness of tsunami evacuation

Currently 38.7% would evacuate immediately, 58.0% would evacuate after some errands, and 3.3% would not evacuate. It is assumed that evacuation would start about 10 minutes after the disaster occurs in the early morning. They want to raise immediate evacuation to 100%, and everything else to 0%. They also want to decrease the response time down to 5 minutes, and increase evacuation speed by x1.5.

If these goals are reached, the number of deaths can be reduced to 0.

Increase and improve earthquake resistance and fire prevention to reduce economic damage

The earthquake will damage homes and lifelines as well as businesses and supply chains. They predict about ￥95.3 trillion (or about USD $744.8 billion) in indirect and direct damage nationwide.

If buildings' earthquake resistances and fire prevention measures are improved, economic damage can be reduced by ￥5.5-9.0 trillion (or USD $43.1-70.6 billion).","the summarized earthquake report can be found on tokyo's disaster prevention website here (japanese):  https://www.bousai.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/_res/projects/default_project/page/001/021/571/20220525/n/00n.pdf  and the full official report can be found here (japanese):  https://www.bousai.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/taisaku/torikumi/1000902/1021571.html  a complete list of all recorded earthquakes in japan by the headquarters for earthquake research (earthquake return rates, 30-year probabilities, etc.):  htt",en,0.09285292759861165,Miyagi|,Miyagi,38.268608080000035,140.87217954000005,120.565,,,,,,

VANCOUVER - British Columbia geoscientists are returning to the scene of a massive landslide on the Fraser River to map its effects and assess the risk of future slides on salmon.

The landslide in November 2018 created a five-metre waterfall on the river north of Lillooet, and made it nearly impossible for migrating salmon to reach their spawning grounds.

Jeremy Venditti, principal investigator on the project, said his team of scientists will map the topography in the area using a laser to identify between 20 and 100 possible slide sites along the river.

“We’re looking for sites that might be sort of an imminent threat, or where an imminent slide may happen, and then we’ll also be identifying locations where they could happen,” he said in an interview Thursday.

Venditti said his team set up a field site on the same location of the 2018 slide almost a decade before that, so they’ll be able to compare their findings with the 2009 data to see how the slide changed the river and how to better predict these events.

“We felt that, as geoscientists, it was time for us to go and begin investigating where in the Fraser other landslides have happened in the past, but also (where they) will happen in the future, and the effects that they have on flow in the river, fish migration and the genetics of Fraser salmon, which we think have probably been impacted now a number of times by landslides.”

Venditti said they’ll share the information with the Fisheries Department and First Nations communities, so they can prepare for potential slides and make plans to protect the salmon.

He said possible mitigation could include engineering solutions like building fishways that can help salmon get past blocked passages.

The Fisheries Department said that 85,000 cubic metres of rock fell into the river, stopping many salmon runs from migrating.

After the remote slide was discovered, fish were transported past the site using helicopters, trucks and a so-called salmon cannon until a fish ladder was built, although the department said in July that it was still looking for a more permanent solution.

The department has said the slide is a major factor in some of the worst salmon returns on record in the Fraser River.

# UPDATE: Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure

Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

 

#### UPDATE: June 14 at 6:38 p.m.Northern portion of Yellowstone National Park likely to remain closed for a substantial length of time due to severely damaged, impacted infrastructure; Visitors traveling to park in coming weeks must stay informed about current situation, road and weather conditions

**Updates**

* Aerial assessments conducted Monday, June 13, by Yellowstone National Park show major damage to multiple sections of road between the North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana), Mammoth Hot Springs, Lamar Valley and Cooke City, Montana, near the Northeast Entrance.
* Many sections of road in these areas are completely gone and will require substantial time and effort to reconstruct.
* The National Park Service will make every effort to repair these roads as soon as possible; however, it is probable that road sections in northern Yellowstone will not reopen this season due to the time required for repairs.
* To prevent visitors from being stranded in the park if conditions worsen, the park in coordination with Yellowstone National Park Lodges made the decision to have all visitors move out of overnight accommodations (lodging and campgrounds) and exit the park.
* **All entrances to Yellowstone National Park remain temporarily CLOSED** while the park waits for flood waters to recede and can conduct evaluations on roads, bridges and wastewater treatment facilities to ensure visitor and employee safety.
* **There will be no inbound visitor traffic at any of the five entrances into the park, including visitors with lodging and camping reservations, until conditions improve and park infrastructure is evaluated.**
* The park’s southern loop appears to be less impacted than the northern roads and teams will assess damage to determine when opening of the southern loop is feasible. This closure will extend minimally through next weekend.
* Due to the northern loop being unavailable for visitors, the park is analyzing how many visitors can safely visit the southern loop once it’s safe to reopen. This will likely mean implementation of some type of temporary reservation system to prevent gridlock and reduce impacts on park infrastructure.
* At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding. 
* Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.
* The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.
* Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

**Known damage** **and issues**

* Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes:  

   * North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon
   * Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees
   * Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road
   * Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation
* The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.
* Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.    

**Stay informed**

* Visitors planning to travel to Yellowstone in the upcoming weeks should stay informed about the current situation and pay close attention to the status of road and weather conditions.

At this time, there are no known injuries nor deaths to have occurred in the park as a result of the unprecedented flooding.

Effective immediately, Yellowstone’s backcountry is temporarily closed while crews assist campers (five known groups in the northern range) and assess damage to backcountry campsites, trails and bridges.

The National Park Service, surrounding counties and states of Montana and Wyoming are working with the park’s gateway communities to evaluate flooding impacts and provide immediate support to residents and visitors.

Water levels are expected to recede today in the afternoon; however, additional flood events are possible through this weekend.

Known damage and issues

Known damage (at this time) to some park roads includes: North Entrance (Gardiner, Montana) to Mammoth Hot Springs: road washed out in multiple places, significant rockslide at Gardner Canyon Tower Junction to Northeast Entrance: segment of road washed out near Soda Butte Picnic Area, mudslides, downed trees Tower-Roosevelt to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass): mudslide on road Canyon Junction to Fishing Bridge: Segment of road just south of Canyon Junction potentially compromised and closed for evaluation

The power continues to be out in multiple locations in the park.

Water and wastewater systems at Canyon Village and Mammoth Hot Springs are being impacted by flooding conditions and are being monitored.

A mudslide in southern Argentina has killed three Uruguayan tourists in a hotel

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Three Uruguayan tourists died in the southern Argentine city of San Carlos de Bariloche when a torrent of mud and other debris filled their hotel rooms.

Rescue workers on Wednesday located the bodies of two tourists who had been missing in the Bustillo Hotel, according to the public prosecutor’s office of the province of Rio Negro, where San Carlos de Bariloche is located.

The other person who was killed had been found hours after the mudslide that caused tons of mud to rush into the hotel on Monday afternoon following a big rainstorm. Three others were injured and remain hospitalized.

The two bodies located early Wednesday morning were on the bed in a hotel room that had been covered to the roof with mud and other debris.

“Half of the mud was removed before we could reach the people who were in the bedroom, lying down on the bed,” Patricia Díaz, subsecretary of Bariloche Civil Protection, said.

“It pains my heart to get information of loss of lives every year during monsoons. My heart goes out to the departed souls and survivors, who are mostly near and dear ones. As I pray for eternal peace for the departed souls, I reiterate that such disasters can be avoided if we respect nature and use common sense in building houses, earth-cutting and blocking natural flow of streams and rivulets,” Khandu said in a message this evening.

He said that the district administration has identified and earmarked buildings as temporary relief camps and people in vulnerable places may either shift there to other places till the situation returns to normalcy.

The chief minister assured that ex-gratia to the deceased and relief to the injured will be provided by the government as per norms.

As per reports, at least five persons lost their lives and six got injured in two separate incidents of landslides in Itanagar since Sunday.

The deceased have been identified as Nagen Barman (40) and Tapas Roy (15), Tai Yai (45) and Teg Bahadur Sonar (52).

The Itanagar Capital Region administration has designated the government higher secondary school at ESS sector here, the government middle school at Kankarnallah, Naharlagun and Nikum Niya Hall at Banderdewa, as temporary relief camps.

The people have been asked to call toll free No 1077 or 878-7336331 and 9436415828 in case of any eventuality.

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded as road clearing operations were underway, they added.

The road from Itanagar to Gohpur in Assam was also blocked due to mud slips. Landslides were also reported from Karsingsa block point along the Itanagar-Banderdewa NH-415, Itanagar Gompa and RWD Colony here, officials said.

The whereabouts of the woman, who along with two others were buried alive in a landslide at Punjabi Dhaba on Sunday night, is yet to be known even after more than 40 hours of search operations, police said.

Inclement weather is hampering the rescue operation with more landslides reported at the spot, they said.

Two PWD labourers were also buried in a landslide at Ganga-Jully Basti Road on Monday afternoon while trying to extricate a motorcycle stuck in the mud.

Hurricane Agatha caused flooding and mudslides that killed at least 10 people and left 20 missing, the governor of the southern state of Oaxaca said on Tuesday.

Alejando Murat said rivers overflowed their banks and swept away people in homes, while other victims were buried under mud and rocks.

“There were fundamentally two reasons” for the deaths, Murat told local media. “There were rivers that overflowed, and on the other hand, and the most serious part, were landslides.”

Murat said the deaths appeared to be concentrated in a number of small towns in the mountains, just inland from the coast. But he said there were also reports of three children missing near the resort of Huatulco.

Agatha made history as the strongest hurricane ever recorded to come ashore in May during the eastern Pacific hurricane season.

It made landfall on Monday afternoon on a sparsely populated stretch of small beach towns and fishing villages in Oaxaca.

It was a strong Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph, but it quickly lost power moving inland over the mountainous interior. Remnants of Agatha were moving north-east on Tuesday into Veracruz state.

Murat said power had been restored to some communities near the coast, but that some bridges had been washed out and mudslides blocked a number of highways. San Isidro del Palmar, only a couple miles inland from the coast, was swamped by the Tonameca river that flows through town.

Residents waded through neck-deep water to salvage what items they could from their homes, walking gingerly with piles of clothing atop their heads and religious figures in their arms.

Argeo Aquino, who has lived in the town his whole life, said he could recall only two other occasions when he saw such flooding. “The houses are totally flooded, so they are getting everything out,” Aquino said Monday as he watched his neighbours. “There are stores, houses. More than anything else, we have to try to save all the good material, because everything else is going to be washed away.”

The Tonameca’s brown waters reached the windows of parked cars and the minibuses used for local transportation.

Nearby, heavy rain and high winds lashed the beach town of Zipolite, known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe. The wind howled for about six hours on Monday, said Silvia Ranfagni, manager of the Casa Kalmar hotel in Zipolite.

“The sound of the wind was really loud, high-pitched,” said Ranfagni. “It started at 1pm when the telephone coverage went out and it didn’t calm down until 7.30. A lot of trees were down, roads washed out. A lot of metal and thatched roofs were blown off.”",Deaths amid flooding and mudslides as Hurricane Agatha hits Mexico,[],2022-05-31 00:00:00,,"Hurricane Agatha caused flooding and mudslides that killed at least 10 people and left 20 missing, the governor of the southern state of Oaxaca said on Tuesday.

CODY, Wyo., June 13 (Reuters) - Record flooding and rockslides unleashed by an unprecedented burst of heavy rains prompted the rare closure on Monday of all five entrances to Yellowstone National Park at the start of the summer tourist season, the park superintendent said.

The entire park, spanning parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, will remain closed to visitors, including those with lodging and camping reservations, at least through Wednesday, as officials inspect damage to roads, bridges and other facilities.

The closures come as Yellowstone was gearing up to celebrate its 150th anniversary year, and as local communities heavily dependent on tourism were counting on a rebound following COVID-19 travel restrictions over the past two summers.

All five park entrances were closed to inbound traffic for the first summer since a series of devastating wildfires in 1988. The National Park Service said it was working to evacuate visitors and staff remaining at various locations, especially in the hardest-hit northern flank of Yellowstone.

""It is likely that the northern loop will be closed for a substantial amount of time,"" the park superintendent, Cam Sholly, said in a statement.

The ""gateway"" community of Gardiner, Montana, just beyond the park's northern boundary and home to many of Yellowstone's workers, was cut off by a mudslide to the north and washed-out road surfaces to the south, according to the National Park Service.

Picture taken June 13, 2022. National Park Service/Handout via REUTERS. Read More

Aerial footage released by the Park Service showed large swaths of the winding North Entrance Road between Gardiner and park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, carved away by surging floodwaters along the Gardner River - washouts that will likely take months to fully repair.

Power outages were scattered throughout the park, and preliminary assessments showed numerous roadways across Yellowstone either washed away or covered in rocks and mud, with a number of bridges also damaged, the agency said.

Various roads in the park's southern region were on the verge of being flooded, with more rain in the forecast.

The flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider Intermountain West following one of the region's wettest springs in many years. The park service characterized the rainfall and floods sweeping the park as unprecedented, with the Yellowstone River topping its banks beyond record levels.

A sudden spike in summer temperatures during the past three days also has hastened melting and runoff of snow accumulated in the park's higher elevations from late-winter storms.

The heavy rains and rapid runoff of snow melt converged to create treacherous conditions in the park just two weeks after the traditional Memorial Day holiday weekend kickoff of the U.S. summer tourist season, which accounts of the bulk of Yellowstone's annual 4 million visitors.

Yellowstone, established as the world's first national park in 1872 and treasured as one of America's top outdoor travel destinations, occupies some 2.2 million acres (890,308 hectares)famed for its geysers, abundant wildlife and spectacular scenery.

Helena, Mon. (NEXSTAR) —On Monday, a deluge wiped out at least one bridge, washed away roads, and caused a landslide in Yellowstone National Park.

Authorities closed all five entrances, began evacuating visitors from the northern part of the park, and warned that the park was temporarily closed due to a “very dangerous situation.”

Park officials said roads to and from the Gardiner community in Montana, just north of the park, were impassable. Kam Sholy said the loop on the north side of the park could be closed for quite some time.

Park officials planned to evacuate visitors from the park’s South Loop on Monday afternoon. This is because more rain is expected.

Higher levels of flood forecasts prompted the decision, along with concerns about water and wastewater, according to Shory.

&gt; BEIJING - The driver of a high-speed train in southern China was killed and eight people were injured when two cars derailed early Saturday after hitting a mudslide, state broadcaster CCTV reported.

&gt; Those injured were in stable condition and the other 136 people aboard the train were evacuated safely, CCTV said.

&gt; China has the world&amp;#039;s most extensive high-speed rail network, with 40,000 kilometers of tracks nationwide and trains running at more than 300 kilometers per hour.

&gt; The system&amp;#039;s safety record has been generally good, with the exception of a 2011 collision between two trains outside the southern city of Wenzhou that left at least 40 people dead and prompted a public uproar over an apparent effort to cover up the extent of the damage.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s aviation sector has also come under scrutiny lately following the still unexplained crash of a China Eastern Airlines passenger jet on March 21 in which all 132 people on board were killed.

Two coaches of D2809, a bullet train from Guiyang, Southwest China's Guizhou Province, to Guangzhou, South China's Guangdong Province, derailed at a tunnel entrance of Rongjiang station in Guizhou due to a mudslide that intruded into the rail track at 10:30 am on Saturday, leading to the death of the driver.One car attendant and seven passengers sustained non-life threatening injuries, and have received proper treatment, said a post on the official Weibo account of Southwest Railway, owned by the Chengdu Bureau of China Railway.The 7th and 8th coaches of the train derailed at Yuezhai tunnel entrance. Photos posted by Southwest Railway showed that the train head is severally damaged. According to videos posted online by passengers, the train had emergently braked when the accident happened, and passengers felt huge impacts. Electricity at the train was cut off after the accident.All injured people were sent to the local hospital, and the other 136 passengers have been transferred and excavated. The on-site rescue work is in full swing, and the cause of the accident is under investigation.The local firefighter rescue team has sent 11 vehicles with 52 personnel to the site for rescue work in the first time, according to a post on the official Weibo account of Guizhou Firefight. China Railway also sent teams to the site for rescue work.The driver, who unfortunately died during the accident, spotted an abnormal rail track when the bullet train ran through Yuezhai tunnel, and quickly instituted emergency braking measures in five seconds that only made the train slide over 900 meters, China Railway said on Saturday, after analyzing on-board data.The against-hit wall of the high-speed railway and the tunnel structure have prevented the train from falling and overturning, according to China Railway.The local hospital said that 12 injured passengers have been hospitalized as of 2pm, with some hurt in their heads and shoulders, news website cqcb.com reported. Another two passengers are being rescued in ICU.A local official at Yuezhai said that the places where the accident happened have never experienced mudslide before. The cqcb.com report quoted the official as saying that mud from an expressway above the Yuezhai tunnel, which is under construction, slid due to rains and ""submerged"" the rail track within 2 or 3 minutes.Due to the impact of the train accident, all bullet trains from Guiyang North station to Guangzhou have been suspended, while bullet trains from Guangzhou to Guiyang all are delayed at stops.China Railway said its Chengdu bureau should organize emergency rescue and reopen the rail line as soon as possible.The D2809 train is run by CRH2A Harmony high-speed bullet train.

So I used to live in the town of Midway, Utah. Which up until about 7 years ago was a farming town before it became a popular cabin town as it was located only about 5 miles away from Park City, Utah. Founded in 1891, but there were people living there since 1850. It became a busy hub with mining along side Park City. And there was one ""major"" mine up Snake Creek Canyon that not many today know existed. As you are only able to find evidence of its existence in the town archives at the town hall. Perhaps because it was never given a name. But the two documents I could find about the mine are a mention of its owners name in a water damaged parchment, ""*Illegible* L. Farr,"" and short newspaper clipping from *The Salt Lake Tribune* about a mining disaster that killed 17 (but I estimate that number to be in the 20-30's.)

But the way they mined this area was not by digging a tunnel, but by striping away layer after layer of dirt and rock on top(a very unusual way to mine back then may I add). With the small settlement sitting at the bottom of this scrape away mine looking for ore on the surface. And, as we all know getting rid of the vegetation, and leaving dirt above this exposed pit is the perfect scenario for a mudslide. Especially with the heavy snow melts we get each spring loosening the soil. And as you have all guessed by now, a mudslide did happen. killing whoever was at the bottom camp/shanty town, a very horrible way to die suffocating and being crushed under dirt and rubble. Which is where a majority of the townsfolk agree Claire has originated from. That she was a young girl(probably mid-late teens by appearance) who was caught up in this tragic accident. And has ever since been trapped in Snake Creek Canyon not able to return to the spirit world.

But every so often, especially when a lightning storm is around, people tend to catch slight glimpses of her. Now she's not one of the shadow figures or just blobs of light you tend to hear about. She is a full body apparition, who glows like someone is shining a flashlight on her. Now no words can truly describe what I saw, but try your best to imagine this. Imagine a teen girl, probably around 5' 2""-6"" dressed in pioneer clothes. So a long dress to the knees with the a white apron in front (google ""pioneer clothes"" and that will give you a good idea.) She has blond-brown hair about to her shoulder. And a, as many put it, ""a near perfect face."" But that's not why she stands out. It's because of this aura around her. Almost like that small bit of blue around a lighting strike where the air has been heated up so it has that waviness to it. But also has that same feeling of the power and intensity of lighting. But the most stunning thing that, along with many other paranormal events, is the eyes. A brilliant brightness to them with shades of blue ever changing inside them, with the sclera and pupil(the white and black parts of the eyeball) still as visible as a living human. And people sometimes catch glimpses of her eyes while driving on stormy nights not to far off in the trees. Not because they're looking for her, but because they stand out so much more vividly than a animals.

But one of the most terrifying and exiting moments of my life was when I was at my family cabin. And happened to be standing, if not closer, 30 feet away from her. Looking down at her from the balcony at our cabin. This particular event happened in the late evening of May 24th, 2019. Right at the time of year when the snow was melting and not many people were up there because most people don't use there cabins in the winter, as the road is not plowed or maintained until spring. But I just caught a glimpse of something in the trees while inside looking out the window, thinking it to be a deer or moose I went outside to see it. And as walked outside whatever was there before had vanished. So I began to walk back inside until I got this beyond powerful feeling that something was looking at me from the tree line. So I turned around, and I kid you not, she just appeared slowly there before me. First the eyes then the rest followed suit. But for what felt like hours, but could not have been more than 10 seconds, she just stared right at me. With those powerful and lifelike, yet lifeless, eyes. Locking me in place as what I can describe as only a trance. Washed over with extreme feelings of loneness and helplessness. Making me, as the only reasonable explanation I can give, feel what she was feeling. And just as fast as she had appeared, she started slowly fading away. The body fading first, leaving those piercing eyes looking at me last. And I probably stood there for another 30 seconds just contemplating what I saw. Wondering like mad it was a trick of the light or of the mind. But the second I realized I could not explain what I just saw, I ran inside and went to the highest floor and locked myself in the bathroom with the lights on until the sun came up.

As summer tourist season ramps up, record-breaking floods in Yellowstone National Park and dangerous mudslides have swept away homes, ripped apart bridges and forced evacuations of surrounding communities isolated without power.

On Tuesday, a video showed a home in Gardiner, Montana, collapsing into the murky waters of Yellowstone River.

Yellowstone River reached highs not seen in our lifetimes, at almost 14 feet on Monday. The previous record of 11.5 feet occurred more than a century ago, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Yellowstone National Park covers nearly 3,500 square miles in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. It sits atop a volcanic hot spot with about half the world’s active geysers.

Nearby Park County said water and air rescues were underway Monday and issued shelter-in-place orders.

Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater (JSE: SSW) (NYSE: SBSW)[ halted production](https://thevault.exchange/?get_group_doc=245/1655186855-LogoFloodeventinMontanaaffectstheStillwatermineUSPGMoperations14Jun2022.pdf) at its two platinum group metals (PGMs) operations in Montana on Monday night after heavy flooding damaged an access road.

The company said that sustained warm weather in the past days led to rapid snow melt in mountains, which, together with heavy rainfall over the weekend, caused flooding of numerous rivers in the region where its mines are located.

The torrential rain has also triggered mudslides, which have damaged road and bridges. “This is likely to restrict access to the Stillwater mine for some period that will be better known in the next few days,” spokesman James Wellsted said in a statement.

Wellsted added that the East Boulder mine was less affected and access to it currently remains intact.

The impact of the floods on production is yet to be determined, the company said, noting that no injuries have been reported after the incident.

Sibanye-Stillwater’s Montana mines produced a combined 570,400 ounces of PGMs last year. These operations account for around 20% of the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, according to BMO analysts’ estimates.

The record flooding and rockslides forced Yellowstone National Park, which spans parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, to [shut for the first time in 34 years](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dramatic-video-shows-montana-house-collapsing-yellowstone-river-record-rcna33420).

It is uncertain how many visitors are stranded or have been forced to leave the park and how many people who live outside it have been rescued and evacuated.

Hikers who were hoping to hit the Eagle Creek Trail before the new Columbia River Gorge timed-permit program went into effect will have to pick a different destination for the time being. A significant rock slide has blocked the popular route.

The U.S. Forest Service announced the trail closure May 14 on its social media platforms. The slide happened about 1 mile from the trailhead, and measures approximately 25 feet wide. The agency did not say how long they expected the path to remain off-limits or when cleanup crews would arrive and begin their work.

Landslides are more likely to happen in an area like this forested canyon, which was damaged in the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire sparked by a Washington teenager who tossed fireworks into the ravine.

The order came as photos of the alleged landslide posted on social media captured the attention of netizens.

Bambalan said the agency and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau or MGB have already formed an investigating team that will go to San Agustin in Isabela to investigate the real cause of the landslide.

Initial information gathered by Bambalan revealed that a crater at the top of the mountain could have been the cause of the landslide triggered by heavy rains.

The DENR had also sought the help of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Isabela for an aerial survey to determine if indeed there is a crater on top of the mountain.

“Maging ang tulong ng mga katutubong agta para samahan ang investigating team dahil masukal umano ang lugar,” a report from the Cagayan Provincial Information Office said.

Authorities are eager to know the exact location of the landslide to assess the incident.

A netizen posted on his Facebook account photos of landslide with caption ‘Mahal naming Sierra Madre, bakit may sugat ka, sana’y huwag lumala ang sugat mo. Sanay mapansin natin ito.’

A Bellevue family who lost their home when it was pushed off its foundation during a January landslide filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the city for unspecified damages.

The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, claims the city was negligent when officials failed to warn the Surdi family about aging water pipes or mitigate the risk of the pipes failing, the Seattle Times reported.

John Surdi said he woke on Jan. 17 after a neighbor called and told him about water gushing down his driveway. Surdi said he drove to a nearby parking lot and moments later, his home of over 20 years slid off its foundation and partially collapsed with his wife and dog in it.

WASHINGTON CITY TO PAY $2M TO SETTLE POLICE KILLING LAWSUIT

The Surdi family has argued that the city was to blame because a section of the water main that ran behind their home broke, causing the landslide. The pipe was made of asbestos cement, which is ""more likely to fail catastrophically than iron pipes,"" according to Bellevue’s planning documents.

The family filed a $5 million claim against the city March 9. Previously, the city said it was possible a natural landslide might have caused the pipe to break. The city has not responded to the claim, spokesperson Brad Harwood said Wednesday.

Landslides involve the movement of a large mass of earth down a slope and they can be caused by various factors including poor soil structure, rainfall, drought, erosion, and seismic activities (earthquakes). An avalanche is the movement of large snow volumes.

What is the process of soil creep?

Soil creep is a very slow movement, occurring on very gentle slopes because of the way soil particles repeatedly expand and contract in wet and dry periods. When wet, soil particles increase in size and weight, and expand at right angles. … As a result, the soil slowly moves down slope.

Is landslide a calamity?

Landslides occur when ground on slopes becomes unstable. … Given the nature of such disasters, fast relief and rescue operations are required to get to trapped survivors but this can be delayed due to landslides cutting off easy access to the affected area.

What is soil creep?

Soil creep defines the slow mass wasting process of soil on a slope, under the influence of gravity (Source: Glossary of Soil Science terms, Soil Science Society of America). … It was also stated that the majority of rates of solifluction affected soil movement down to 50 cm of depth.

What is an example of a soil creep?

One example of soil creep in real life is from the wealthy Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tabogo. … The movement of the soil caused instability and triggered other, more dramatic forms of mass wasting such as debris flows, and the road required reconstruction to combat the one-inch-per-year creep in the area.

What causes creep movement?

Creep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward movement of slope-forming soil or rock. Movement is caused by shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too small to produce shear failure.

What are 4 types of landslides?

Landslides are part of a more general erosion or surficial pro- cess known as mass wasting, which is simply the downslope movement of earth or surface materials due to gravity. They are classified into four main types: fall and toppling, slides (rotational and translational), flows and creep.

What causes landslide?

Landslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris.

Two people are dead after being caught in a coal pile landslide Thursday at the Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo.

The victims, who are employees of subcontractor Savage Systems, were about 25-30 feet up on an 80-foot-tall coal pile when the surface below them gave way, said Pueblo Fire Department PIO Erik Duran.

Duran said the two men, one his 20s, the other in his 30s were fully exhumed around 4:30 p.m. Officials found the victim around 3 p.m. and the second shortly there after. Duran said medical personnel on scene determine that resuscitation efforts would not be viable, effectively saying they were dead on scene.

Duran described the coal pile as ""very unstable."" He added that he did not know what caused the landslide but that such information would come from Savage.

A Flight for Life helicopter and ambulances were standing by.

Duran said that the sheer weight of the landslide and the possibility of suffocation are the biggest dangers to the victims.

QUIRINO — The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Region 2 claimed that there were no traces of illegal activities in Sierra Madre.

Photo from the DENR

Regional Executive Director Gwendolyn Bambalan of the DENR issued the statement after conducting an investigation to determine the cause of a landslide which covers an approximate average width of 90 meters and total height of 1,592 meters above sea level.

The landslide took place at Sitio Diariong, Barangay Villa Gracia, Maddela, Quirino.

“The landslide incident was a natural occurrence due to heavy rains,” stressed director Bambalan.

The investigating team was composed of personnel from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Offices of San Isidro in Isabela and Nagtipunan in Quirino and the local government units of San Agustin and Maddela towns.

Bambalan added that the area is covered with mossy forest and limestone rock formation within the Quirino Protected Landscape.

She also noted that the team discovered bedrocks and boulders along the Sili Creek found at the foot of the incident area, and discolored flowing water from the top of the landslide site.

Bambalan also noted the absence of inhabitants or community in the area and that no traces of illegal activities were found in the site and nearby areas.

The investigators spent almost a week to reach the exact location of the landslide in the mountain.

The agency has yet to ascertain the condition of the uppermost area of the mountain and determine what possibly caused the landslide incident.

The DENR together with the Mines and Geosciences Bureau has scheduled aerial surveillance in coordination with proper authorities to identify what caused the landslide.

The DENR conducted the investigation after a netizen posted on his Facebook account photos of landslide with caption ‘Mahal naming Sierra Madre, bakit may sugat ka, sana’y huwag lumala ang sugat mo. Sanay mapansin natin ito.’

The post went viral in social media with 17,000 reactions when shared by Philippine Weather System/Pacific Storm Update.

MONTREAL - Almost 200 people in Saguenay, Que., have been forced to leave their homes and belongings behind as the area faces a high risk of a landslide.

City officials declared a state of emergency on Saturday and asked inhabitants of 53 homes in the borough of La Baie to evacuate before 7 a.m. Sunday.

The order came after 21 households were evacuated in the region north of Quebec City earlier this week, following a landslide that swept away an empty house on Monday.

Saguenay Mayor Julie Dufour told reporters Sunday that families forced to flee could be out of their homes for weeks or even months. She said they’d get help from the city to relocate.

“As the mayor, it warms my heart that everybody is alive,” Dufour said. “We were able to avoid a disaster.”

Officials said the ground underneath the evacuated area is unstable and it could lead to a massive landslide similar to the Saint-Jean-Vianney disaster.

Hundreds of residents of Saint-Jean-Vianney, also in the Saguenay region, were left without homes in May 1971, after a gigantic landslide swept through the community, killing 31 people.

“Right now, everything is possible,” Dufour said, warning against scaring residents with such a comparison.

“Are there going to be houses that aren’t going to be able to remain there? Homes that will stay but with stabilizing renovation? Others without? It’s too early to say.”

The priority is to evacuate as fast as possible, said Saguenay Fire Department Chief Carol Girard at a Sunday press conference.

While the risk of a landslide was “imminent,” he said more ground analysis is needed in the upcoming days to determine whether additional people need to be displaced.

Andree Laforest, Quebec municipal affairs minister, said at the same press conference that Geneviève Guilbault, the provincial public security minister, was considering whether the province would also declare a state of emergency.

In the meantime, 30 homes were made available for evacuated residents and support and accommodation services were put in place with the Red Cross, the Saguenay, and the public security ministry, Laforest added.

Camping sites have offered accommodation, along with seniors’ residences and other places might be made available in the future, she said.

“It’s a shock, but residents can see we avoided the worst.”

“This precipitation has fallen on our mountain snowpack which has added even more water into our river systems,” said Steve Barton of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a press release.

Barton said several points throughout the basin will reach flood stage.

“Of primary concern to us at this point is public safety,” he said. “This system of dams was built primarily to protect the public from catastrophic floods. While we cannot prevent all flooding, we can take steps to minimize the impacts of these powerful weather events.”

Rising water levels in the Willamette River closed a portion of Portland’s popular multi-use path, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, from the Morrison Bridge to the Steel Bridge. City officials say it could remain closed for several days. The river is expected to rise to 15.5 feet.

The Columbia River also rose over the weekend, reaching 15.6 feet by mid-Sunday. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning along the river from Vancouver to Longview.

Flood stage in Vancouver is 16 feet (4.87 meters), and forecasters say river levels will approach that level repeatedly through late Wednesday morning. At 16 feet, minor flooding occurs, affecting islands and low-lying areas, with minor impacts on parks or trails along the river, according to the National Weather Service.

The NWS also issued a flood watch for much of northeastern Oregon through Sunday night. Officials warned people to be on the lookout for potential landslides.

Landslides can occur near steep terrain, especially near burned areas from recent wildfires, and they can move faster than a person can run.

This is not the first time that a similar tragedy has been recorded in the gold mining villages of the Eastern region. In May 2021, the collapse of two mines in Kambele, in the Batouri district, killed several dozen people, including children.

Between 2013 and April 2021, Foder recorded a total of 157 deaths at mining sites in Cameroon. Of these deaths, 25% were due to drowning and landslides caused by open pits left by miners. Of the 100 deaths whose ages are known, 38 are between 0 and 20 years old. Cameroon counts over 185 death due to gold extraction in the mines.","the population of belita, a village in the kadey division , located on the border with the central african republic, continued to search for the bodies of miners who disappeared on thursday evening in an earthquake.  according to village sources, relayed by ”forêts et développement rural” (foder), seven people were engulfed in this new gold mining site opened in belita. three men and two women, each carrying a baby on their back, were reportedly swallowed up. but on its facebook page, the daily ",en,0.11096170811013642,Kambele|Batouri,Kambele,4.466670000000022,14.400000000000034,1.5665,,,,,,

**“So you’re just going to leave, then?”** Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”

Avians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.

Poire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.

Now, those siblings were running away. Most of them were avian, but Poire spotted one creature with bulging yellow eyes and green, leathery scales wearing a priest’s walking clothes. Some were rushing. Others tried to move with a quiet dignity, as if they thought they were doing the right thing.

“Where are you going to go, then?” Muqwa shouted at the throngs. He pointed at one red-feathered avian. “Sister Inakah, what are you going to do?”

“Survive,” Inakah said. She was just as old and round as Muqwa. “At least, I hope to. And if you know better, you will leave too, Muqwa.”

“What about the Oracle? What about our order?”

“The Oracle is silent, as always.”

She was already walking away.

“Brother Osul,” Muqwa called to another avian, who was carrying a bulging knapsack over his shoulder. Silver and other precious metals glinted out of the top. “Are those from the temple? Are you *stealing from the gods*?”

“Mind your own roost, Muqwa. The gods help those who help themselves.”

Muqwa opened his mouth to argue when Poire tugged at his robes. Reminding him of their purpose.

But Muqwa was too worked up. His jowls quivered with fury. “You call yourselves faithful. Pwah! Faith would have you here to protect our sacred home from these ransacking cyrans. What if the Savior returns? *Where will you be?*”

One or two of the priests stopped long enough to look back at Muqwa, at the temple and the tower. But they would not change their minds. The fire over the Midcity was growing taller. The clouds, blacker.

Brother Osul, on the other hand, was still standing there, his brow feathers cocked high.

“Who’s this?” Osul nodded at Poire.

“A lost fledgling, that’s all.”

Osul stared.

Muqwa put a protective hand out, pushing Poire behind him. “I found him on my way from the garden.”

But the answer didn’t seem to satisfy Osul. Poire could feel the brother’s gaze lingering on his robes, searching for his face beneath the shadow of his hood. Poire shifted uncomfortably, and even his armor began to stir again somewhere beneath his clothes. He pulled his hood tighter over his face.

There was a shout behind them. A patrol of cyrans were shoving one of the priests around, pulling a knapsack off her shoulders and dumping its contents onto the ground. She threw up her hands, letting them take it, letting them tear through the books and papers.

“Quickly,” Muqwa whispered to Poire, turning him away from Osul, “let’s get inside before anyone sees you.”

The easternmost tower, just like the leaning tower, was not how Poire remembered it. Huge stone walls had been constructed around the tower, completely walling in the central pylon. Still, the tower was unmistakable. It soared hundreds of feet above the other buildings.

Arches ringed the base of the tower, forming dozens of entrances to the inner monastery.

Muqwa went in first to make sure that it was clear to enter. And then, he beckoned Poire to follow.

Inside, the sound of the world changed. Footsteps became shuffling echoes, and every breath sounded like the rumbling earth. Torches and pockets filled with candles lit the dusky atrium. There was a kind of excitement in the priest’s gait as he led them down a set of steep, seastone steps that curved around the center of the tower.

“Right this way. And watch the stairs, they’re sharp.”

The steps were cramped and worn smooth from centuries of use; Poire’s feet wanted to slip on them. Candles and torches were replaced by gaslights encased in fragile, cloudy glass. A glow ushered in shadows from below.

Here, the lights numbered in the hundreds. A cavernous basement stretched as far as he could see, filled to brimming with the steady warmth of lanterns and the glint of gold. Precious metals had been crafted into symbols of the Faith that hung on the walls and the heavy, stone columns. Color had been worked into the stones so that the polished floor was one enormous mural.

The smell of natural gas was so rich it was hard to think. All Poire could hear was the hissing of fuel flowing through a network of pipes that crawled across the corners of the floor.

The ceilings were covered with paintings, flecked and peeling. Each one showed another scene, often of human beings. Sometimes they were tending to plants or feeding animals. This one was a woman whispering into the ear of a bird. Here was a man reaching into the water where a scaled hand rose up to meet his. And directly above Poire was a human sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, a whole forest of trees growing out of his flesh. Each scene was a new masterpiece.

*They built all this? Burning gas to see and carving with such crude tools?*

There was a gleam of metal from the center of the temple. One of eight pylons, built by humans so long ago. The pylon held up all this stone, just like it once held something else.

But Muqwa drew his attention to an altar covered with a pale linen cloth. Gold stitching embroidered the cloth in an intricate pattern.

“There it is.” Muqwa bowed at the altar. “The Oracle.”

“It’s a control panel.”

“Hmm?” Muqwa said.

But how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.

*Maybe it still has power,* Poire thought.

“It looks like it needs maintenance.”

“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”

“Since when do control panels give instructions?”

“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”

“You think?”

“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed *yet*. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”

“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.

“Yes?”

He hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”

“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.

Poire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?

*What can you possibly see in me?*

Beyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.

Judging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.

“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.

“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”

Muqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.

“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.

This time, Poire thought he knew the answer. *The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.*

But as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.

A shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. *Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?*

“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.

“Do you hear anything?”

Muqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.

“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”

Copper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.

*Is that gas? In open containers?* No wonder it was so hard to think down here. *Do they know how dangerous that is?*

“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”

Poire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”

He heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.

“How—how did you—”

And then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”

Around the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.

Muqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “*By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.*”

Poire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”

“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”

Brother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.

Poire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.

Muqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.

“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”

A gunshot.

Muqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*

“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”

“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”

Poire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. *How is there already so much of it?* It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.

“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.

A faint whisper. “Look.”

One feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. *Why is the stupid fool smiling?*

“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”

The priest’s eyes closed.

Unlike the door, they would never open again.

Tears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.

“Grab him.”

The soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of *him*.

“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”

Poire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.

One of the cyrans was screaming.

Poire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.

The door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.

Wrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.

A machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”

Poire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.

One of the cyrans was screaming.

Poire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.

The door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.

Wrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.

A machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”

“So you’re just going to leave, then?” Muqwa shouted at the scattered throngs of priests and clerics. “You cowards! Apostates!”

Avians of every feather hung their heads in shame, but they did not stop walking away. They abandoned their temples and the libraries that grew up the cliff walls and against the tower itself. Most of them carried knapsacks full of books or relics.

Poire and Muqwa were standing in the shadow of the easternmost tower. Ages ago, a huge section of the cliff wall had collapsed here, and the landslides wrapped around the base of the tower. Stone workers cut at the landslide so that the tower seemed to have been chiseled out of the rock itself. Walkways and switchbacks crawled up the cliff, leading to dozens of shrines and homes for the siblings of the Faith and the working clergy.

Now, those siblings were running away. Most of them were avian, but Poire spotted one creature with bulging yellow eyes and green, leathery scales wearing a priest’s walking clothes. Some were rushing. Others tried to move with a quiet dignity, as if they thought they were doing the right thing.

“Where are you going to go, then?” Muqwa shouted at the throngs. He pointed at one red-feathered avian. “Sister Inakah, what are you going to do?”

“Survive,” Inakah said. She was just as old and round as Muqwa. “At least, I hope to. And if you know better, you will leave too, Muqwa.”

“What about the Oracle? What about our order?”

“The Oracle is silent, as always.”

She was already walking away.

“Brother Osul,” Muqwa called to another avian, who was carrying a bulging knapsack over his shoulder. Silver and other precious metals glinted out of the top. “Are those from the temple? Are you stealing from the gods?”

“Mind your own roost, Muqwa. The gods help those who help themselves.”

Muqwa opened his mouth to argue when Poire tugged at his robes. Reminding him of their purpose.

But Muqwa was too worked up. His jowls quivered with fury. “You call yourselves faithful. Pwah! Faith would have you here to protect our sacred home from these ransacking cyrans. What if the Savior returns? Where will you be?”

One or two of the priests stopped long enough to look back at Muqwa, at the temple and the tower. But they would not change their minds. The fire over the Midcity was growing taller. The clouds, blacker.

Brother Osul, on the other hand, was still standing there, his brow feathers cocked high.

“Who’s this?” Osul nodded at Poire.

“A lost fledgling, that’s all.”

Osul stared.

Muqwa put a protective hand out, pushing Poire behind him. “I found him on my way from the garden.”

But the answer didn’t seem to satisfy Osul. Poire could feel the brother’s gaze lingering on his robes, searching for his face beneath the shadow of his hood. Poire shifted uncomfortably, and even his armor began to stir again somewhere beneath his clothes. He pulled his hood tighter over his face.

There was a shout behind them. A patrol of cyrans were shoving one of the priests around, pulling a knapsack off her shoulders and dumping its contents onto the ground. She threw up her hands, letting them take it, letting them tear through the books and papers.

“Quickly,” Muqwa whispered to Poire, turning him away from Osul, “let’s get inside before anyone sees you.”

The easternmost tower, just like the leaning tower, was not how Poire remembered it. Huge stone walls had been constructed around the tower, completely walling in the central pylon. Still, the tower was unmistakable. It soared hundreds of feet above the other buildings.

Arches ringed the base of the tower, forming dozens of entrances to the inner monastery.

Muqwa went in first to make sure that it was clear to enter. And then, he beckoned Poire to follow.

Inside, the sound of the world changed. Footsteps became shuffling echoes, and every breath sounded like the rumbling earth. Torches and pockets filled with candles lit the dusky atrium. There was a kind of excitement in the priest’s gait as he led them down a set of steep, seastone steps that curved around the center of the tower.

“Right this way. And watch the stairs, they’re sharp.”

The steps were cramped and worn smooth from centuries of use; Poire’s feet wanted to slip on them. Candles and torches were replaced by gaslights encased in fragile, cloudy glass. A glow ushered in shadows from below.

Here, the lights numbered in the hundreds. A cavernous basement stretched as far as he could see, filled to brimming with the steady warmth of lanterns and the glint of gold. Precious metals had been crafted into symbols of the Faith that hung on the walls and the heavy, stone columns. Color had been worked into the stones so that the polished floor was one enormous mural.

The smell of natural gas was so rich it was hard to think. All Poire could hear was the hissing of fuel flowing through a network of pipes that crawled across the corners of the floor.

The ceilings were covered with paintings, flecked and peeling. Each one showed another scene, often of human beings. Sometimes they were tending to plants or feeding animals. This one was a woman whispering into the ear of a bird. Here was a man reaching into the water where a scaled hand rose up to meet his. And directly above Poire was a human sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, a whole forest of trees growing out of his flesh. Each scene was a new masterpiece.

They built all this? Burning gas to see and carving with such crude tools?

There was a gleam of metal from the center of the temple. One of eight pylons, built by humans so long ago. The pylon held up all this stone, just like it once held something else.

But Muqwa drew his attention to an altar covered with a pale linen cloth. Gold stitching embroidered the cloth in an intricate pattern.

“There it is.” Muqwa bowed at the altar. “The Oracle.”

“It’s a control panel.”

“Hmm?” Muqwa said.

But how could Poire explain? This waist-high station, this dome, was just an access node. The tower’s manual control, mostly used for troubleshooting. The chrome shell was worn with a patina of scratches, scrapes, and smudges of tarnish where generations of hands had touched the shell in the same spots.

Maybe it still has power, Poire thought.

“It looks like it needs maintenance.”

“Hmph,” Muqwa crooned defensively. “We take the utmost care of it. For over a thousand years, our order has followed the Oracle’s instructions to the letter.”

“Since when do control panels give instructions?”

“I’ll admit, the Oracle’s words have been . . . sparse these last . . . well, I’ve heard it speak once. I think.”

“You think?”

“Yes. We’ve pieced together what we can, and we never fail in our duties. Or at least we have not failed yet. But as long as I draw breath,” he said, breathing deep and straightening his back, “I will attend the Oracle.”

“Muqwa?” A thought struck Poire. Maybe it was the gas making him light-headed.

“Yes?”

He hesitated. “Thank you for helping me find my way. This world is strange to me. And the people . . .”

“Your presence is all the reward I could ever need.” Muqwa bowed his head.

Poire swallowed. What was he supposed to say to that?

What can you possibly see in me?

Beyond the control panel, Poire saw a shape in the metal pylon: the outline of a door.

Judging by all those scratches, it looked like someone had tried to open it and failed. Arcane symbols were painted over the arch in a silvery paint that glistened in the gaslights.

“What do you keep in there?” Poire nodded at the door.

“Ah, that is called The Door Which May Never Open. As its name would suggest, no one has ever been in there. Some say it leads to a secret gate, which leads to gods-know-where. Others say it is a symbol left here by the gods, a reminder that we are mortal and there are things we cannot do. Some paths will always be closed to us mere mortals.”

Muqwa appraised the door with a wondering curiosity dancing in his eyes.

“There are others still who say that a great treasure lies inside. Wonders from the gods that await their return.” Again, Muqwa gave him that expectant look, as if Poire might have all the answers.

This time, Poire thought he knew the answer. The door leads to an elevator. One of the maintenance shafts for the pylon. That’s it.

But as Poire thought about it, he realized that maybe, to these people, to Muqwa, such a simple fact could be miraculous. Even the emergency lights seemed to fascinate them.

A shuffling sound stole his attention. He tuned his ears. Are those footsteps, or is the gas just getting to me?

“Something wrong?” Muqwa asked.

“Do you hear anything?”

Muqwa tilted his head, listening to the silence.

“It is quieter than normal in here. Normally, it takes three of us to tend to the lights and the offerings. Speaking of which, let me show you. This is how we speak to the Oracle. Or attempt to, at least.”

Copper wires crisscrossed the floor in front of the control panel, braided over and into each other as they fanned down from the dome. They fed into crude generators, simple engines that were hooked up to open tanks.

Is that gas? In open containers? No wonder it was so hard to think down here. Do they know how dangerous that is?

“Awakening the Oracle,” Muqwa said, “is a very complicated, drawn-out process. It requires the utmost attention to detail. One slip, and we must begin the whole process again. First, we attune the alternators.” Muqwa gestured at the generators. “That’s the Oracle’s word for these engines. Now—”

Poire put his palm on the dome. The moment his fingers grazed the chrome surface, a light sprang up. Holographic displays swirled around the dome, coming to a stop in front of him. Towering blue and black letters spelled out: “Welcome, New User.”

He heard a strangled gasp from Muqwa.

“How—how did you—”

And then the letters changed: “Tower 3 Status: Offline.”

Around the corners of the display, new menu options materialized. All but one were greyed out: “Need Help?” These letters glowed faintly.

Muqwa’s beak worked at empty air. A hundred emotions played across his feathery face. His eyebrows twitched and bounced, his beak opened and closed. Slowly, he sank to his knees, muttering a prayer. “By the Divine, I am not worthy. I am a worm beneath the dirt.”

Poire crouched down next to him, leveling his face with the priest’s. He wanted to tell Muqwa to stop debasing himself. He wanted to show him how it worked. “It’s just a control panel. Here—”

“There!” The voice echoed across the temple. It cut through the hiss of gas like a blade through flesh. “There he is! I’ve found them!”

Brother Osul was crouched on the steps. And behind him, more shouts. The stomping of boots, the jingling of metal, the rushing of soldiers in uniform.

Poire threw his hood back on, but it was too late. They had seen.

Muqwa threw his arms out, spreading his wings to cover Poire.

“You will not touch him!” he shouted, his whole body quavering with righteous fury. “You shall not lay a finger upon his Divine being!”

A gunshot.

Muqwa jerked and dropped to the floor like a sack of grain*.*

“No!” Poire was screaming. “No!”

“Don’t shoot!” another cyran shouted. “Can’t you smell the gas? Don’t shoot, damn you!”

Poire fell upon the old avian, trying to press his hands against the wound as if somehow that would help. There was so much blood. How is there already so much of it? It dripped down the avian’s beak and shone on the side of his head where one of the bullets had ripped away those graying feathers and the skin underneath. It even spattered across the black chrome of the control panel.

“Muqwa, can you hear me?” Poire grabbed at his robes, trying to pull him back up to a sitting position. Poire’s armor rippled and dripped through Muqwa’s feathers as if trying to help Poire hold him.

A faint whisper. “Look.”

One feathered finger stretched out, pointing beyond the control panel. He was smiling. Why is the stupid fool smiling?

“The door opens for you, Poire.” A gap formed in the wall of the pylons. “Just like the prophecy said . . .”

The priest’s eyes closed.

Unlike the door, they would never open again.

Tears were streaming down Poire’s cheeks. His hands were red with blood that was not his. A dozen guards gathered around him. Those blue-and-black uniforms were just shapes, blurred by the tears in his eyes.

“Grab him.”

The soldiers moved in, forming a loose circle around him, but none of them wanted to touch him. They were afraid of him.

“What are you doing? Grab him, you fools! Grab him!”

Poire was the first to move. He ran through a gap in their circle. Two cyrans tried to close ranks against him, but as Poire’s body collided with theirs, the liquid armor lashed out. Vicious spears of metal pierced through Poire’s clothes, ripping his cold suit and stabbing at their palms and arms, riddling them with holes.

One of the cyrans was screaming.

Poire dashed up the steps and ran through the open door of the pylon.

The door slammed shut behind him. The light from the temple was gone.

Wrapped in the safe silence of darkness, there was nothing but the cold metal floor and Poire’s heaving gasps.

A machine’s voice broke the silence. “Are you real?”

KENAI, Alaska (AP) — Officials this week intend to reopen a road that has been closed for more than two weeks following a massive landslide that cut off access to the city of Seward from a smaller community.

The May 7 slide cut off travel between Lowell Point and Seward, which is about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south of Anchorage. No injuries were caused by the slide, which measured about 300 feet (91 meters) wide by 200 feet (60.96 meters) long and was caught on camera by several people.

Barge service that moved more than 115 vehicles between Lowell Point and Seward ended Monday. The Kenai Peninsula Borough will cover the cost of moving the vehicles by barge from Lowell Point, the Peninsula Clarion reported.

Water taxi service for essential travel between the two communities was expanded Sunday when the state transportation department began offering service through a charter company. Another local company has been providing regular water taxi service.

Emergency management officials in a web post say the road is expected to reopen for two-lane traffic at noon on Friday. The road will remain open 24 hours a day until May 31, when it will be closed between 8 a.m.-5 p.m. until June 2 so more blasting work can be completed.

90,1653338279,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/uw9rhy/how_i_lost_my_soulmate_and_where_im_going_from/,1,"I tend to type massive novels but I'll try and make my story as quick as possible (lol that didn't happen), so please bare with me. I've had a rough go at dating in my life. I'm 28, I've lived alone with my cat for 2 years now, and I've only had 6 ""official"" girlfriends. 4 of those 6 ended up cheating on me. My longest relationship was 5 years during my time in college from 2015-2020, and she cheated on me with her ex during an unbearably long month full of being gaslighted and emotionally manipulated. I had to basically restart my life from scratch after that, which led me to where I live currently.

It took over a year for me to even begin to think of dating again, and I eventually found myself stuck with a horrible alcoholic for about a month. She cheated too, which was more of a blessing in that instance since it gave me a way out without feeling too guilty. The next one was several months later and was one of the only 2 that didn't cheat. Problem is this girl was head over heels for me and I just wasn't feeling it at all. We stayed together about 3 months and she constantly pressured me about making things ""official"" and very clearly had some codependency issues. I broke things off with her in person one night after my feelings reached a boiling point, which of course crushed her. I felt like I was only with her because of how sick I was feeling so lonely 24/7. After that I fully intended on just working on some internal issues and finding my own happiness for a few months. 

Well barely 2 months later right before Valentine's Day this year I ended up getting a friend request and a message from a girl that I work with. I'm a cake decorator at Walmart and she's one of the grocery pickup people who walks around the store. I had always had a crush on her and thought she was so insanely beautiful but for whatever reason I never pursued those feelings. 

Anyways. Me and this girl hit it off like immediately. Within 2 responses we were typing the longest messages you could possibly imagine over every single topic we could think of. I mean we had virtually everything in common and our personalities just clicked so well and so fast and it was very apparent to me that this one could finally be different because never in my 28 years have I so instantly vibed so well with a girl before. It was as if we knew each other our whole lives or something.

We start seeing each other and hanging out as often as our schedules would allow us, just growing closer and closer and closer. There were so many super bizarre coincidences between us too. For instance, her dad and my mom shared their first kiss together in like 1974, which still blows my mind. Even smaller things like how we both owned the same obscure sweaters from a website that like 5 people know about. I don't even know if I believe in fate, but this was by far the closest I'd ever felt to believing in it. And not to get too mushy but I'm telling you guys that this girls lips and my lips just felt like they were literally made for each other. Our kisses created such massive explosive fireworks for both of us and it was obvious just by how obsessed we were with them and how easy it was to just let 3 hours go by after nothing but kissing and doing foreplay type stuff together and every single touch just felt so perfect and so comforting.

Well about a month into dating I made my first horrible horrible mistake. I started feeling so anxious and so terrified of the possibility of losing her and having to see her around work and what that could do to me. So one day I just sent her a stupid long message saying that I basically didn't know if we should continue talking because I was so scared of all of the worst case scenarios. I have a really hard time not bringing past relationship trauma into new ones given my track record and it just got to me because it all just seemed too good to be true. Well of course I immediately regretted that decision and we found ourselves talking again pretty much the next day because she was gracious enough to forgive me for my lapse of judgement. 

Another month goes by and we still hadn't even had sex yet and I still hadn't even committed to being official with her. But I did know without a shadow of a doubt that I was madly in love with her in a way that I never even felt during my 5 year relationship. It makes me feel so stupid looking back. We had a big trip planned to stay in a cabin for 2 days in Gatlinburg on 4/20 and 4/21 and I think I was subconsciously waiting for that trip to really open up and give her all I had and finally commit to her and stop letting all of my bottled up past crap get in the way of this girl that I felt I had been looking for my entire life.  

Well unfortunately, like 3 nights before the big trip something happened. She came over one night, one thing led to another, and we tried having sex for the first time. Then the most embarrassing moment of my entire life happened. I couldn't get it up. God it was so humiliating and I felt so horrible. It had nothing to do with my attraction to her, it was simply a case of me putting WAY too much pressure on myself and letting it consume me. I awkwardly drove her back home and we didn't say a word for the rest of the night after that. 

The next day I had to work and I felt so ashamed of myself that day. We hadn't sent our daily good morning voice messages to each other (something I've never felt comfortable enough to do with any girl before) and I was just expecting a horrible text at any moment. Well eventually the moment came and she texted me this long novel filled with uncomfortable topics and lumped in the middle of it was this question about whether we should just be friends or not. Me being me, I thought it was her way of saying that's what SHE wanted without making me feel bad. I assured her that the previous night had nothing to do with her and that I guess we should just be friends. I thought either I chose that or I just lost her forever. She had also asked if I still wanted to do the trip as friends and I told her to just give me a day or so to think about it because I just didn't know how to feel about anything on that day. I wish so much that I had just asked her to have a talk with me in person.

And again, I immediately regret my decision. The next day I told her that I absolutely still wanted to go on the trip so we could just talk and I could finally open up about all of these intense feelings I was bottling up for so long. Well suddenly her friend from out of town was coming early and suddenly she couldn't go. And suddenly everything she was saying to me was super short and super dismissive with no emojis at all. I just felt so small and powerless. 

I spent the next day just freaking out to myself about the trip we had spent nearly $600 on, which I ended up just going on by myself and coming back after the first night because I just felt stupid being there by myself like that. I tried opening up some more to her about my feelings but I could barely get a response from her at that point. And eventually she suggested we just move on and not talk for a while. This completely devastated me and I became a total emotional wreck from losing someone I felt so strongly about in a way I had never felt before. This girl became my best friend practically overnight and to lose her in such a stupid way still haunts me all day every day.

I know the best thing to do at this point is to just let it be and not contact anymore, but we all know how impossible that feels, especially when you really don't have many other friends or things to do to preoccupy your time with. Because I had taken a week of paid vacation off for the trip, I still had to spend the next few days completely alone just dwelling on all of my mistakes and how regretful I was for just agreeing to be friends after everything I felt with her and how sure of myself I was.

Eventually I came back to work. Then I spent the next week constantly seeing her and trying to get back in her life but she wouldn't even so much as look at me and by that point I had been left on delivered on Messenger even when just asking how she's been and simply saying that she was on my mind. That week was already miserable enough but I wasn't at all prepared for what came next. One day, I start noticing her walking around with this other guy at work. Then days kept on passing and I just had to sit and watch with my own eyes as she took every break and every lunch with him. I couldn't handle it man. After about a week of that emotional torture, I broke down one day and just cried profusely in the bakery freezer for about 20 minutes. I felt worthless and I embarrassed myself in front of a lot of coworkers and customers that day. When I got off work I cracked and sent her a long message explaining what I had been going through and how I so desperately just wanted to talk to her about some things in person. This was after a week of forcing myself not to say anything.

She immediately opened that message and responded in such a dismissive way as if she had no idea what I was talking about and didn't really know how to respond yet and needed some time. In my head that obviously confirmed all of my suspicions, but I told her to take as much time as she needed. The next day she sends another message saying she still doesn't really know what to say and still can't really properly respond yet. I told her that I could just explain my situation and my feelings over text if it was the only way and that she could just go from there, and she agreed to it. So I shit you not, I spent about 9 hours that night typing the longest message I've ever written in my life. Explaining every single horrible regret I had, how horrible seeing her with another guy was mentally destroying me, how completely and utterly in love with her I was but never got to express properly in time, how stupid I felt over ever agreeing to just be friends, and how ashamed I was for our last time being in the same room together having to be the one and only time we ever had a bad night together. It was just all so much. 

A day goes by and around 10pm the next night I finally got her response. It killed me. It was just this long message about how she had no idea about my feelings because I made it so hard to let her in from all of my past trauma. And how I caused her so much pain from opening up her own wounds with abandonment trauma from being so wishy washy. And how things with this other guy just ""kinda happened"" and that things were already pretty serious and they had met families and stuff already, which I hadn't even done from being so reluctant to just accept my feelings. She said she'd try to make sure they stay away from me at work as much as possible and that maybe we should stop being friends across social media and just keep each other's numbers if she ever wants to reach out again in the future to be friends again. Of course this message was literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I went into a classic message frenzy in a blind fit of mental collapse and depression. Freaking out about work, expressing how stupid I felt, how ashamed I was, how much I hated losing my best friend, and freaking out about work some more. 

I genuinely couldn't bare the thought of having to continue watching them on a daily basis. That's my literal worst nightmare. I told her I'd have to quit, which obviously made her feel bad but it was my only option to avoid completely losing my mind. Eventually she stopped responding. I sent her one more novel that night after calming down a little bit and told her I'd try going into work and just dealing with it.

Well I went to work the next day and neither of them were even there. But it didn't matter. I spent the first 2 hours just crying and making a fool of myself. I took a 3 hour lunch. 2 one hour breaks. That place held so much negative energy and so many painful memories, I just couldn't do it. I sent her a short embarrassing voice message crying profusely on my lunch telling her I just couldn't do it and I had to leave and that I was sorry for everything. 

The next day I texted her telling her that I was going to be in Walmart at a certain time to quit just to give her a heads up if she wanted to avoid me and that I had one last novel to send expressing my final thoughts on everything. I went, I put in my 2 weeks notice with the full intention of never coming back, left, and sent my message. It was basically more of the same but I tried assuring her that I'd be okay and that maybe this was just something I needed to happen in my life and that I wished her nothing but happiness and hoped we could one day reconnect again. No response of course. 

The following week was the most painful week of my life by a landslide. I quit my job with no plan at all. I lost my best friend and the only girl in 28 years that's ever made me feel so alive. I had less friends to talk to that I could count on one hand. I noticed she had blocked me on Facebook, logged out, and then saw her new profile picture and relationship status. God that image just stays seared into my head every second of every day. I completely fell apart and this was my lowest point. I spent that week trying everything in my power to remain productive with my time and do literally anything at all to keep my mind occupied.

I drove to my mom's at all hours of the day and night just to vent and get some reassurance. Cried nearly every other hour. Spent SO much time sitting at this computer applying at jobs and trying to work on resumes and muster up the motivation to maybe draw a bit in Photoshop or something. I even started therapy and scheduled doctor's appointments for later this month to seek professional help. Nothing helped though. The days went by so slowly and every day was just so pretty outside. I'd try going to the park to draw in a sketch book but I just felt stupid and always ended up cooped up back at home alone again. I reached out to so many people and shared my story and everyone just kept reassuring me that she just needs time and that I need to focus on myself for a while in the meantime. It's just so hard to force yourself to do that when you feel so low. All I ever did was think about what they're probably doing and how he's doing all of the stuff I should've done from the very beginning with her. I've never felt so worthless in my life and I let myself slip into some horribly dark places that I'm sure many of you have unfortunately experienced yourselves.

One day I just decided what I needed to do. I hadn't said a word since I quit the previous week and the only way I was going to get closure for me to move on and heal was by sending her my deepest, most honest, raw feelings and regrets through a voice message. I didn't want there to be a shadow of a doubt regarding tone or intent or any of the issues that texting causes. So I recorded a 30 minute message. It was the most calm, collected, honest, sincere message I could ever imagine. Towards the end, I made it clear that I wouldn't ever bother her again and that this wasn't some desperate attempt to make her break things off with the new guy and that this was simply for my own closure and sanity and that I fully expected to not hear from her for months, if ever. I just needed her to understand the gravity of my feelings. 

Well. Later that night I got a response from her and it wasn't at ALL what I expected. Just this big message about how she was starting to feel scared and harrassed and was feeling so uncomfortable and that she couldn't even finish it. She told me she was going to block my number and that it was clear we couldn't ever be friends or anything and that she tried being nice but that I just simply wouldn't accept reality and that she hopes I continue therapy and getting help but that she isn't ever going to be the girl for me. I immediately drove to my mom's a sobbing mess and showed her and I just felt like jumping off of a bridge at that point. Not only did I lose my best friend and this seemingly perfect girl that I felt the universe created for me but I pushed her to the point of loathing me and wanting nothing to do with me at all. This was last week. 

After several hours of just crying and mentally collapsing in front of my mom, who's really the only person I have at any given moment, I started feeling a little different. I suddenly felt comfortable enough to come back to work. To see the girl I thought SO highly of speak to me as if I was some psycho stalker creep when I'm so obviously just a horribly horribly heartbroken man with several deep regrets was such an awful but necessary thing to happen. Don't get me wrong, I was devastated. I also made an ass of myself and sent her a message in the heat of the moment through my mom's number just expressing how deeply hurt I was from that and how the girl I thought she was simply wasn't real and how I couldn't believe she was ""scared"" of such an open and obviously sincere love letter expressing my sheer gratitude for her being in my life. I regret sending that now but it felt justified at the time.

Later that night I went to Waffle House with my mom at like 4am and we ended up staying up until like 9am talking about it all and how much I just hope I get to hear from her again someday. That was Thursday morning. I called Walmart, let them know I was coming back, and then went back to work last Friday. Friday was extremely difficult and hard to deal with but I got through it. Saturday was a little better since it was so busy but there was one awkward encounter. I always take my first break at the same time and it just so happens to be when they take their lunch. 

Well they went on lunch that day and I went on my break shortly after. I walked to my car to grab my vape pen and then walked over to an outdoor table they have set up to get some fresh air. On the way to the table I unexpectedly saw her walking towards me to get to her car and I didn't really know what to do. We were within like 6 feet of each other and I just kinda awkwardly lifted my drink as like a ""Hey"" but she just looked right through me with the least expressive face I'd ever seen. It cut like daggers but I just kept walking and went on with the rest of my day.

That brings us to yesterday, which was probably the best day of the bunch. I made it a point to be as happy and chipper as possible anytime she was around and to never acknowledge her whatsoever, and that's what I'll continue trying to do from here on out. I still go to my mom's pretty much every day to have the same conversations over and over because it's still incredibly painful and I want nothing more but to hear from her but things are out of my hands at this point and I have no choice but to move on to the best of my ability.

My mom is like 100% that I'll hear from her one day after she gets a taste of being with this new guy. Not trying to be an ass I promise, but he has kids, he smokes cigarettes, and he's not really the most attractive guy to be honest. She always expressed to me how she didn't really want kids at all and I know for a fact that their physical chemistry together couldn't possibly be as explosive as ours was. I'm sure he's sweet and fun to talk to but that can only take you so far I feel like.

I know the best course of action is to just stop thinking about it and let things play out how they will and move on as if I'll never hear from her again because that's very much a possibility anyways. It's just so hard going through such a painful traumatic experience with very few healthy coping mechanisms and very few friends you feel a genuine connection with. My biggest fear is my own standards. They were already through the roof before finding her but now they're just impossible to fill.

It's already difficult enough being a single guy in his late 20s who doesn't really want kids, but to have found someone so unbelievably special and then losing them so horribly is going to make things so much more difficult moving forward. There was this other girl I was slightly interested in and we've been talking a bit and she's been so sweet and so understanding and also thinks the girl acted way too irrationally over the message, but we just aren't clicking. I compare every message to what she would've said and how much easier it was for me to talk to her in comparison. I just felt so comfortable. I mean I even loved singing for that girl and I've never done that with anyone in my life. lol

Anyways, here I am, on a website I pretty much never use, just venting about my story and hoping it reaches someone else out there who might be experiencing heartbreak or severe depression. Moving forward I'm going to continue therapy, I'm going to get medicinal help, and I'm adopting a new kitty tomorrow. Funny story about that actually. My first therapy visit was on Friday the 13th and they had 3 little black kittens there for adoption. One of them cuddled up to me during the entire session and once again it just felt like fate. And I had been procrastinating on getting a black cat for years at that point. I mean how weird is that? I'm super excited for my cat Pumpkin to finally have a little sister and to just have another little kitten around in general. 

I'm not gonna pretend like I don't hope I hear from her someday. It's honestly what I want more than anything in this world. But in the meantime, I'm gonna just do me and try my best to not let things get to me. I hope you're all doing well out there and I appreciate you reading this massive novel. Haven't ever really done anything like this publicly tbh.

Then I spent the next week constantly seeing her and trying to get back in her life but she wouldn't even so much as look at me and by that point I had been left on delivered on Messenger even when just asking how she's been and simply saying that she was on my mind. That week was already miserable enough but I wasn't at all prepared for what came next. One day, I start noticing her walking around with this other guy at work. Then days kept on passing and I just had to sit and watch with my own eyes as she took every break and every lunch with him. I couldn't handle it man. After about a week of that emotional torture, I broke down one day and just cried profusely in the bakery freezer for about 20 minutes. I felt worthless and I embarrassed myself in front of a lot of coworkers and customers that day. When I got off work I cracked and sent her a long message explaining what I had been going through and how I so desperately just wanted to talk to her about some things in person. This was after a week of forcing myself not to say anything.

She immediately opened that message and responded in such a dismissive way as if she had no idea what I was talking about and didn't really know how to respond yet and needed some time. In my head that obviously confirmed all of my suspicions, but I told her to take as much time as she needed. The next day she sends another message saying she still doesn't really know what to say and still can't really properly respond yet. I told her that I could just explain my situation and my feelings over text if it was the only way and that she could just go from there, and she agreed to it. So I shit you not, I spent about 9 hours that night typing the longest message I've ever written in my life. Explaining every single horrible regret I had, how horrible seeing her with another guy was mentally destroying me, how completely and utterly in love with her I was but never got to express properly in time, how stupid I felt over ever agreeing to just be friends, and how ashamed I was for our last time being in the same room together having to be the one and only time we ever had a bad night together. It was just all so much.

A day goes by and around 10pm the next night I finally got her response. It killed me. It was just this long message about how she had no idea about my feelings because I made it so hard to let her in from all of my past trauma. And how I caused her so much pain from opening up her own wounds with abandonment trauma from being so wishy washy. And how things with this other guy just ""kinda happened"" and that things were already pretty serious and they had met families and stuff already, which I hadn't even done from being so reluctant to just accept my feelings. She said she'd try to make sure they stay away from me at work as much as possible and that maybe we should stop being friends across social media and just keep each other's numbers if she ever wants to reach out again in the future to be friends again. Of course this message was literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I went into a classic message frenzy in a blind fit of mental collapse and depression. Freaking out about work, expressing how stupid I felt, how ashamed I was, how much I hated losing my best friend, and freaking out about work some more.

I genuinely couldn't bare the thought of having to continue watching them on a daily basis. That's my literal worst nightmare. I told her I'd have to quit, which obviously made her feel bad but it was my only option to avoid completely losing my mind. Eventually she stopped responding. I sent her one more novel that night after calming down a little bit and told her I'd try going into work and just dealing with it.

Well I went to work the next day and neither of them were even there. But it didn't matter. I spent the first 2 hours just crying and making a fool of myself. I took a 3 hour lunch. 2 one hour breaks. That place held so much negative energy and so many painful memories, I just couldn't do it. I sent her a short embarrassing voice message crying profusely on my lunch telling her I just couldn't do it and I had to leave and that I was sorry for everything.

The next day I texted her telling her that I was going to be in Walmart at a certain time to quit just to give her a heads up if she wanted to avoid me and that I had one last novel to send expressing my final thoughts on everything. I went, I put in my 2 weeks notice with the full intention of never coming back, left, and sent my message. It was basically more of the same but I tried assuring her that I'd be okay and that maybe this was just something I needed to happen in my life and that I wished her nothing but happiness and hoped we could one day reconnect again. No response of course.

The following week was the most painful week of my life by a landslide. I quit my job with no plan at all. I lost my best friend and the only girl in 28 years that's ever made me feel so alive. I had less friends to talk to that I could count on one hand. I noticed she had blocked me on Facebook, logged out, and then saw her new profile picture and relationship status. God that image just stays seared into my head every second of every day. I completely fell apart and this was my lowest point. I spent that week trying everything in my power to remain productive with my time and do literally anything at all to keep my mind occupied.

I drove to my mom's at all hours of the day and night just to vent and get some reassurance. Cried nearly every other hour. Spent SO much time sitting at this computer applying at jobs and trying to work on resumes and muster up the motivation to maybe draw a bit in Photoshop or something. I even started therapy and scheduled doctor's appointments for later this month to seek professional help. Nothing helped though. The days went by so slowly and every day was just so pretty outside. I'd try going to the park to draw in a sketch book but I just felt stupid and always ended up cooped up back at home alone again. I reached out to so many people and shared my story and everyone just kept reassuring me that she just needs time and that I need to focus on myself for a while in the meantime. It's just so hard to force yourself to do that when you feel so low. All I ever did was think about what they're probably doing and how he's doing all of the stuff I should've done from the very beginning with her. I've never felt so worthless in my life and I let myself slip into some horribly dark places that I'm sure many of you have unfortunately experienced yourselves.

One day I just decided what I needed to do. I hadn't said a word since I quit the previous week and the only way I was going to get closure for me to move on and heal was by sending her my deepest, most honest, raw feelings and regrets through a voice message. I didn't want there to be a shadow of a doubt regarding tone or intent or any of the issues that texting causes. So I recorded a 30 minute message. It was the most calm, collected, honest, sincere message I could ever imagine. Towards the end, I made it clear that I wouldn't ever bother her again and that this wasn't some desperate attempt to make her break things off with the new guy and that this was simply for my own closure and sanity and that I fully expected to not hear from her for months, if ever. I just needed her to understand the gravity of my feelings.

Well. Later that night I got a response from her and it wasn't at ALL what I expected. Just this big message about how she was starting to feel scared and harrassed and was feeling so uncomfortable and that she couldn't even finish it. She told me she was going to block my number and that it was clear we couldn't ever be friends or anything and that she tried being nice but that I just simply wouldn't accept reality and that she hopes I continue therapy and getting help but that she isn't ever going to be the girl for me. I immediately drove to my mom's a sobbing mess and showed her and I just felt like jumping off of a bridge at that point. Not only did I lose my best friend and this seemingly perfect girl that I felt the universe created for me but I pushed her to the point of loathing me and wanting nothing to do with me at all. This was last week.

After several hours of just crying and mentally collapsing in front of my mom, who's really the only person I have at any given moment, I started feeling a little different. I suddenly felt comfortable enough to come back to work. To see the girl I thought SO highly of speak to me as if I was some psycho stalker creep when I'm so obviously just a horribly horribly heartbroken man with several deep regrets was such an awful but necessary thing to happen. Don't get me wrong, I was devastated. I also made an ass of myself and sent her a message in the heat of the moment through my mom's number just expressing how deeply hurt I was from that and how the girl I thought she was simply wasn't real and how I couldn't believe she was ""scared"" of such an open and obviously sincere love letter expressing my sheer gratitude for her being in my life. I regret sending that now but it felt justified at the time.

Later that night I went to Waffle House with my mom at like 4am and we ended up staying up until like 9am talking about it all and how much I just hope I get to hear from her again someday. That was Thursday morning. I called Walmart, let them know I was coming back, and then went back to work last Friday. Friday was extremely difficult and hard to deal with but I got through it. Saturday was a little better since it was so busy but there was one awkward encounter. I always take my first break at the same time and it just so happens to be when they take their lunch.

Well they went on lunch that day and I went on my break shortly after. I walked to my car to grab my vape pen and then walked over to an outdoor table they have set up to get some fresh air. On the way to the table I unexpectedly saw her walking towards me to get to her car and I didn't really know what to do. We were within like 6 feet of each other and I just kinda awkwardly lifted my drink as like a ""Hey"" but she just looked right through me with the least expressive face I'd ever seen. It cut like daggers but I just kept walking and went on with the rest of my day.

That brings us to yesterday, which was probably the best day of the bunch. I made it a point to be as happy and chipper as possible anytime she was around and to never acknowledge her whatsoever, and that's what I'll continue trying to do from here on out. I still go to my mom's pretty much every day to have the same conversations over and over because it's still incredibly painful and I want nothing more but to hear from her but things are out of my hands at this point and I have no choice but to move on to the best of my ability.

My mom is like 100% that I'll hear from her one day after she gets a taste of being with this new guy. Not trying to be an ass I promise, but he has kids, he smokes cigarettes, and he's not really the most attractive guy to be honest. She always expressed to me how she didn't really want kids at all and I know for a fact that their physical chemistry together couldn't possibly be as explosive as ours was. I'm sure he's sweet and fun to talk to but that can only take you so far I feel like.

I know the best course of action is to just stop thinking about it and let things play out how they will and move on as if I'll never hear from her again because that's very much a possibility anyways. It's just so hard going through such a painful traumatic experience with very few healthy coping mechanisms and very few friends you feel a genuine connection with. My biggest fear is my own standards. They were already through the roof before finding her but now they're just impossible to fill.

It's already difficult enough being a single guy in his late 20s who doesn't really want kids, but to have found someone so unbelievably special and then losing them so horribly is going to make things so much more difficult moving forward. There was this other girl I was slightly interested in and we've been talking a bit and she's been so sweet and so understanding and also thinks the girl acted way too irrationally over the message, but we just aren't clicking. I compare every message to what she would've said and how much easier it was for me to talk to her in comparison. I just felt so comfortable. I mean I even loved singing for that girl and I've never done that with anyone in my life. lol

Anyways, here I am, on a website I pretty much never use, just venting about my story and hoping it reaches someone else out there who might be experiencing heartbreak or severe depression. Moving forward I'm going to continue therapy, I'm going to get medicinal help, and I'm adopting a new kitty tomorrow. Funny story about that actually. My first therapy visit was on Friday the 13th and they had 3 little black kittens there for adoption. One of them cuddled up to me during the entire session and once again it just felt like fate. And I had been procrastinating on getting a black cat for years at that point. I mean how weird is that? I'm super excited for my cat Pumpkin to finally have a little sister and to just have another little kitten around in general.

I'm not gonna pretend like I don't hope I hear from her someday. It's honestly what I want more than anything in this world. But in the meantime, I'm gonna just do me and try my best to not let things get to me. I hope you're all doing well out there and I appreciate you reading this massive novel. Haven't ever really done anything like this publicly tbh. Take care guys. <3",How I lost my soulmate and where I'm going from here : heartbreak,[],None,,"I tend to type massive novels but I'll try and make my story as quick as possible (lol that didn't happen), so please bare with me. I've had a rough go at dating in my life. I'm 28, I've lived alone with my cat for 2 years now, and I've only had 6 ""official"" girlfriends. 4 of those 6 ended up cheating on me. My longest relationship was 5 years during my time in college from 2015-2020, and she cheated on me with her ex during an unbearably long month full of being gaslighted and emotionally manipulated. I had to basically restart my life from scratch after that, which led me to where I live currently.

It took over a year for me to even begin to think of dating again, and I eventually found myself stuck with a horrible alcoholic for about a month. She cheated too, which was more of a blessing in that instance since it gave me a way out without feeling too guilty. The next one was several months later and was one of the only 2 that didn't cheat. Problem is this girl was head over heels for me and I just wasn't feeling it at all. We stayed together about 3 months and she constantly pressured me about making things ""official"" and very clearly had some codependency issues. I broke things off with her in person one night after my feelings reached a boiling point, which of course crushed her. I felt like I was only with her because of how sick I was feeling so lonely 24/7. After that I fully intended on just working on some internal issues and finding my own happiness for a few months.

Well barely 2 months later right before Valentine's Day this year I ended up getting a friend request and a message from a girl that I work with. I'm a cake decorator at Walmart and she's one of the grocery pickup people who walks around the store. I had always had a crush on her and thought she was so insanely beautiful but for whatever reason I never pursued those feelings.

Anyways. Me and this girl hit it off like immediately. Within 2 responses we were typing the longest messages you could possibly imagine over every single topic we could think of. I mean we had virtually everything in common and our personalities just clicked so well and so fast and it was very apparent to me that this one could finally be different because never in my 28 years have I so instantly vibed so well with a girl before. It was as if we knew each other our whole lives or something.

We start seeing each other and hanging out as often as our schedules would allow us, just growing closer and closer and closer. There were so many super bizarre coincidences between us too. For instance, her dad and my mom shared their first kiss together in like 1974, which still blows my mind. Even smaller things like how we both owned the same obscure sweaters from a website that like 5 people know about. I don't even know if I believe in fate, but this was by far the closest I'd ever felt to believing in it. And not to get too mushy but I'm telling you guys that this girls lips and my lips just felt like they were literally made for each other. Our kisses created such massive explosive fireworks for both of us and it was obvious just by how obsessed we were with them and how easy it was to just let 3 hours go by after nothing but kissing and doing foreplay type stuff together and every single touch just felt so perfect and so comforting.

Well about a month into dating I made my first horrible horrible mistake. I started feeling so anxious and so terrified of the possibility of losing her and having to see her around work and what that could do to me. So one day I just sent her a stupid long message saying that I basically didn't know if we should continue talking because I was so scared of all of the worst case scenarios. I have a really hard time not bringing past relationship trauma into new ones given my track record and it just got to me because it all just seemed too good to be true. Well of course I immediately regretted that decision and we found ourselves talking again pretty much the next day because she was gracious enough to forgive me for my lapse of judgement.

Another month goes by and we still hadn't even had sex yet and I still hadn't even committed to being official with her. But I did know without a shadow of a doubt that I was madly in love with her in a way that I never even felt during my 5 year relationship. It makes me feel so stupid looking back. We had a big trip planned to stay in a cabin for 2 days in Gatlinburg on 4/20 and 4/21 and I think I was subconsciously waiting for that trip to really open up and give her all I had and finally commit to her and stop letting all of my bottled up past crap get in the way of this girl that I felt I had been looking for my entire life.

Well unfortunately, like 3 nights before the big trip something happened. She came over one night, one thing led to another, and we tried having sex for the first time. Then the most embarrassing moment of my entire life happened. I couldn't get it up. God it was so humiliating and I felt so horrible. It had nothing to do with my attraction to her, it was simply a case of me putting WAY too much pressure on myself and letting it consume me. I awkwardly drove her back home and we didn't say a word for the rest of the night after that.

The next day I had to work and I felt so ashamed of myself that day. We hadn't sent our daily good morning voice messages to each other (something I've never felt comfortable enough to do with any girl before) and I was just expecting a horrible text at any moment. Well eventually the moment came and she texted me this long novel filled with uncomfortable topics and lumped in the middle of it was this question about whether we should just be friends or not. Me being me, I thought it was her way of saying that's what SHE wanted without making me feel bad. I assured her that the previous night had nothing to do with her and that I guess we should just be friends. I thought either I chose that or I just lost her forever. She had also asked if I still wanted to do the trip as friends and I told her to just give me a day or so to think about it because I just didn't know how to feel about anything on that day. I wish so much that I had just asked her to have a talk with me in person.

And again, I immediately regret my decision. The next day I told her that I absolutely still wanted to go on the trip so we could just talk and I could finally open up about all of these intense feelings I was bottling up for so long. Well suddenly her friend from out of town was coming early and suddenly she couldn't go. And suddenly everything she was saying to me was super short and super dismissive with no emojis at all. I just felt so small and powerless.

I spent the next day just freaking out to myself about the trip we had spent nearly $600 on, which I ended up just going on by myself and coming back after the first night because I just felt stupid being there by myself like that. I tried opening up some more to her about my feelings but I could barely get a response from her at that point. And eventually she suggested we just move on and not talk for a while. This completely devastated me and I became a total emotional wreck from losing someone I felt so strongly about in a way I had never felt before. This girl became my best friend practically overnight and to lose her in such a stupid way still haunts me all day every day.

I know the best thing to do at this point is to just let it be and not contact anymore, but we all know how impossible that feels, especially when you really don't have many other friends or things to do to preoccupy your time with. Because I had taken a week of paid vacation off for the trip, I still had to spend the next few days completely alone just dwelling on all of my mistakes and how regretful I was for just agreeing to be friends after everything I felt with her and how sure of myself I was.

Eventually I came back to work. Then I spent the next week constantly seeing her and trying to get back in her life but she wouldn't even so much as look at me and by that point I had been left on delivered on Messenger even when just asking how she's been and simply saying that she was on my mind. That week was already miserable enough but I wasn't at all prepared for what came next. One day, I start noticing her walking around with this other guy at work. Then days kept on passing and I just had to sit and watch with my own eyes as she took every break and every lunch with him. I couldn't handle it man. After about a week of that emotional torture, I broke down one day and just cried profusely in the bakery freezer for about 20 minutes.

She immediately opened that message and responded in such a dismissive way as if she had no idea what I was talking about and didn't really know how to respond yet and needed some time. In my head that obviously confirmed all of my suspicions, but I told her to take as much time as she needed. The next day she sends another message saying she still doesn't really know what to say and still can't really properly respond yet. I told her that I could just explain my situation and my feelings over text if it was the only way and that she could just go from there, and she agreed to it. So I shit you not, I spent about 9 hours that night typing the longest message I've ever written in my life. Explaining every single horrible regret I had, how horrible seeing her with another guy was mentally destroying me, how completely and utterly in love with her I was but never got to express properly in time, how stupid I felt over ever agreeing to just be friends, and how ashamed I was for our last time being in the same room together having to be the one and only time we ever had a bad night together.

Moving forward I'm going to continue therapy, I'm going to get medicinal help, and I'm adopting a new kitty tomorrow. Funny story about that actually. My first therapy visit was on Friday the 13th and they had 3 little black kittens there for adoption. One of them cuddled up to me during the entire session and once again it just felt like fate. And I had been procrastinating on getting a black cat for years at that point. I mean how weird is that? I'm super excited for my cat Pumpkin to finally have a little sister and to just have another little kitten around in general.

I'm not gonna pretend like I don't hope I hear from her someday. It's honestly what I want more than anything in this world. But in the meantime, I'm gonna just do me and try my best to not let things get to me. I hope you're all doing well out there and I appreciate you reading this massive novel. Haven't ever really done anything like this publicly tbh. Take care guys. <3","i tend to type massive novels but i'll try and make my story as quick as possible (lol that didn't happen), so please bare with me. i've had a rough go at dating in my life. i'm 28, i've lived alone with my cat for 2 years now, and i've only had 6 ""official"" girlfriends. 4 of those 6 ended up cheating on me. my longest relationship was 5 years during my time in college from 2015-2020, and she cheated on me with her ex during an unbearably long month full of being gaslighted and emotionally manip",en,0.11147968848717808,Gatlinburg|,Gatlinburg,35.71245000000005,-83.51576999999997,7.159,,,,,,
